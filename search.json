    "text": "Lenses\nThe most important optical elements are lenses, which come in many different flavors. They consist of curved surfaces, which most commonly have the shape of a part of a spherical cap. It is, therefore, useful to have a look at the refraction at spherical surfaces.\n\nRefraction at spherical surfaces\nFor our calculations of the refraction at spherical surfaces, we consider the sketch below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Refraction at a curved surface.\n\n\n\nTo derive an imaging equation for a lens, we aim to calculate the distance \\(b\\) and angle \\(\\theta_2\\) at which a ray crosses the optical axis, given its origin at distance \\(a\\) and angle \\(\\theta_1\\). We begin with Snell’s law for the geometry:\n\\[n_{1}\\sin(\\alpha+\\theta_1)=n_{2}\\sin(\\alpha-\\theta_2)\\]\nWe define key relationships:\n\\[\\sin(\\alpha)=\\frac{y}{R}, \\quad \\tan(\\theta_1)=\\frac{y}{a}, \\quad \\tan(\\theta_2)=\\frac{y}{b}\\]\nTo simplify this, we employ the paraxial approximation, which assumes all angles are small. This allows us to use first-order approximations of trigonometric functions, effectively linearizing them:\n\\[\\sin(\\theta) \\approx \\theta, \\quad \\tan(\\theta) \\approx \\theta,\\quad \\cos(\\theta)\\approx 1\\]\nThis approach, common in optics, significantly simplifies our calculations while maintaining accuracy for most practical scenarios involving lenses.\nWith the help of these approximations we can write Snell’s law for the curved surface as\n\\[n_1(\\alpha+\\theta_1)=n_2(\\alpha-\\theta_2).\\]\nWith some slight transformation which you will find in the video of the online lecture we obtain, therefore,\n\\[\\theta_2=\\frac{n_2-n_1}{n_2 R}y -\\frac{n_1}{n_2}\\theta_1,\\]\nwhich is a purely linear equation in \\(y\\) and \\(\\theta_1\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParaxial Approximation\n\n\n\n\n\nThe paraxial approximation is a fundamental simplification in optics that assumes all angles are small. This allows us to use linear approximations for trigonometric functions, significantly simplifying calculations while maintaining accuracy for most practical scenarios involving lenses.\nTo visualize the validity of this approximation, let’s examine two plots:\n\nThe first plot compares sin(θ) (blue line) with its linear approximation θ (red dashed line) for angles ranging from 0 to π/2 radians.\nThe second plot shows the absolute error between sin(θ) and θ.\n\nThese plots demonstrate that:\n\nFor small angles (roughly up to 0.5 radians or about 30 degrees), the approximation is very close to the actual sine function.\nThe error increases rapidly for larger angles, indicating the limitations of the paraxial approximation.\n\nIn most optical systems, especially those involving lenses, the angles of incident and refracted rays are typically small enough for this approximation to be valid. However, it’s important to be aware of its limitations when dealing with wide-angle optical systems or scenarios where precision is critical.\n\n\n\n\n\nParaxial approximation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider light originating from a point at distance \\(y\\) from the optical axis. We’ll analyze two rays: one traveling parallel to the optical axis and hitting the spherical surface at height \\(y\\), and another incident at \\(y=0\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Image formation at a curved surface.\n\n\n\nApplying our derived formula to these two cases:\nFor the parallel ray (\\(\\theta_1=0\\)):\n\\[\\theta_2=\\frac{n_2-n_1}{n_2}\\frac{y}{R}\\] \\[\\theta_2=\\frac{y+\\Delta y}{b}\\]\nEquating these expressions:\n\\[\\frac{y+\\Delta y}{b}=\\frac{n_2-n_1}{n_2}\\frac{y}{R}\\]\nFor the ray through the center (\\(y=0\\)):\n\\[n_2\\frac{\\Delta y}{b}=n_1\\frac{y}{a}\\]\nCombining these equations yields the imaging equation for a curved surface:\n\\[\\frac{n_1}{a}+\\frac{n_2}{b}=\\frac{n_2-n_1}{R}\\]\nWe can define a new quantity, the focal length, which depends only on the properties of the curved surface:\n\\[f=\\frac{n_2}{n_2-n_1}R\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImaging Equation for Spherical Refracting Surface\n\n\n\nThe sum of the inverse object and image distances equals the inverse focal length of the spherical refracting surface:\n\\[\\frac{n_1}{g}+\\frac{n_2}{b}\\approx\\frac{n_2}{f}\\]\nwhere the focal length of the refracting surface is given by:\n\\[f=\\frac{n_2}{n_2-n_1}R\\]\nin the paraxial approximation.\n\n\n\n\nRefraction with two spherical surfaces\nIn our previous calculation we have found a linear relation between the incident angle \\(\\theta_1\\) with the optical axis, the incident height of the ray \\(y\\) and the outgoing angle \\(\\theta_2\\):\nAnalyzing refraction in a lens involves two spherical surfaces. Light initially travels from a medium with refractive index \\(n_1\\) into the lens material with index \\(n_2\\). The first surface’s radius, \\(R_1\\), is typically positive for a convex surface facing the incident light.\nAt the second surface, the outgoing angle from the first refraction becomes the incident angle for the second refraction. Here, light travels from \\(n_2\\) back into \\(n_1\\). The radius \\(R_2\\) of this surface often has a negative value in a converging lens due to its opposite curvature relative to the optical axis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Refraction on two spherical surfaces.\n\n\n\nFor thin lenses, where the thickness \\(d\\) is much smaller than \\(R_1\\) and \\(R_2\\) (\\(d \\ll R_1, R_2\\)), we can simplify our analysis. We assume that the height of the ray at both surfaces is approximately equal (\\(y \\approx y'\\)), neglecting the displacement inside the lens.\nThis simplification allows us to treat all refraction as occurring on a single plane at the lens center, known as the principal plane. This concept, illustrated by the dashed line in the figure, greatly simplifies optical calculations and ray tracing for thin lenses.\nThe radii’s sign convention (positive for convex surfaces facing incident light, negative for concave) and this two-surface analysis form the basis for the thin lens formula. This formula relates object distance, image distance, and focal length, encapsulating the lens’s imaging properties.\nThe result of the above calculation is leading to the imaging equation for the thin lens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImaging Equation for Thin Lens\n\n\n\nThe sum of the inverse object and image distances equals the inverse focal length of the thin lens:\n\\[\\frac{1}{a}+\\frac{1}{b}\\approx\\frac{n_2-n_1}{n_1}\\left (\\frac{1}{R_1}-\\frac{1}{R_2}\\right )=\\frac{1}{f}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLensmaker equation\n\n\n\nThe focal length of a thin lens is calculated by the lensmaker equation: \\[f=\\frac{n_1}{n_2-n_1}\\left ( \\frac{R_1 R_2}{R_2 -R_1}\\right)\\]\nin the paraxial approximation.\n\n\nThe equation for the focal length has some important consequence. It says that if the difference of the refractive indices inside (\\(n_2\\)) and outside \\(n_1\\) get smaller, the focal length becomes larger and finally infinity. This can be nicely observed by placing a lens outside and inside a water filled basin as shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Lens in air\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Lens in water\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Focusing of parallel rays by a lens in air (\\(n_1=1\\), left) and in water (\\(n_1=1.36\\), right). The images clearly show the change in focal length between the two situations.\n\n\n\n\n\nImage Construction\nImages of objects can be now constructed if we refer to rays which do not emerge from a position on the optical axis only. In this case, we consider three different rays (two are actually enough). If we use as in the case of a concave mirror a central and a parallel ray, we will find a position where all rays cross on the other side. The conversion of the rays is exactly the same as in the case of a spherical mirror. The relation between the position of the object and the image along the optical axis is described by the imaging equation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Image construction on a thin lens.\n\n\n\nSimilar to the concave mirror, we may now also find out the image size or the magnification of the lens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMagnification of a Lens\n\n\n\nThe magnification is given by:\n\\[M=\\frac{h_{\\rm image}}{h_{\\rm object}}=-\\frac{b}{a}=\\frac{f}{f-a}\\]\nwhere the negative sign is the result of the reverse orientation of the real images created by a lens.\n\n\nAccording to our previous consideration \\(M&lt;0\\) corresponds to a reversed image, while it is upright as the object for \\(M&gt;0\\). We, therefore, easily see the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObject Position\nImage Characteristics\nMagnification (M)\nImage Type\n\n\n\n\n\\(a &lt; f\\)\nUpright and magnified\n\\(M &gt; 0\\)\nVirtual\n\n\n\\(f &lt; a &lt; 2f\\)\nReversed and magnified\n\\(M &lt; -1\\)\nReal\n\n\n\\(a = 2f\\)\nReversed, same size\n\\(M = -1\\)\nReal\n\n\n\\(a &gt; 2f\\)\nReversed and shrunk\n\\(-1 &lt; M &lt; 0\\)\nReal\n\n\n\\(a = f\\)\nAppears at infinity\n\\(M = \\infty\\)\n-\n\n\n\nThe image below illustrates the construction of images in 4 of the above cases for a bi-convex lens, including the generation of a virtual image.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig.: Image construction on a biconvex lens with a parallel and a central ray for different object distances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThick lens\nFor a thin lens, the displacement of the beam in height (\\(y,y^{\\prime}\\)) due to the thickness has been neglected. That means that we can reduce all refracting action of the lens to a single plane, which we call a principle plane. This approximation is (independent of the paraxial approximation) not anymore true for lenses if the displacement \\(\\Delta\\) of the ray as in the image below cannot be neglected. Such lenses are called thick lenses and they do not have a single principle plane anymore. In fact, the principle plane splits up into two principle planes at a distance \\(h\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Thick lens principal planes.\n\n\n\nAs indicated in the sketch above, an incident ray which is not deflected can be extended to its intersection with the optical axis at a point, which is a distance \\(h_1\\) behind the lens surface. This is the location for the first principle plane. The position of the second principle plane at a distance \\(h_2\\) before the back surface is found for by reversing the ray path. According to that, both principle planes have a distance \\(h=d-h_1+h_2\\) (mind the sign of the \\(h\\)). Using some mathematical effort, one can show that the same imaging equation as for a thins lens can be used with a new definition of the focal length and taking into account that object and image distances refer to their principle planes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImaging Equation for Thick Lens\n\n\n\nThe sum of the inverse object and image distances to the principal planes (\\(H_1,H_2\\)) equals the inverse focal length of the thick lens:\n\\[\\frac{1}{a}+\\frac{1}{b}\\approx\\frac{1}{f}\\]\nwhere the inverse focal length of the thick lens is given by:\n\\[\\frac{1}{f}=n-1\\left (\\frac{1}{R_1}-\\frac{1}{R_2}+\\frac{(n-1)d}{n R_1 R_2}\\right )\\]\nin the paraxial approximation.\n\n\nThe location of the two principle planes are found to be\n\\[h_{1}=-\\frac{(n-1)f d}{n R_2}\\] \\[h_{2}=-\\frac{(n-1)f d}{n R_1}\\]\nAs compared to the construction of an image on a thin lens, we now have to consider some pecularities for the thick lens. An incident parallel ray, which turns into a focal ray is now refracted at the second principle plane. The reverse must, therefore, be true for an incident focal ray. This ray is refracted on the first principle plane. The central ray is deflected on both principle planes. It is incident under a certain angle at the first principle plane and outgoing with the same principle angle to the second principle plane. The sketch below summarizes these issues for a thick lens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Thick lens image construction.\n\n\n\n\n\nLens types\nDepending on the radii of curvature and their sign, one can construct different types of lenses that are used in many applications. Modern microscopy lenses, for example, can contain up to 20 different lenses, each with carefully designed curvatures and materials to correct for various optical aberrations and achieve high-quality imaging.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Different lens types.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Convex plane thick\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Convex plane thin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Bi-concave lens\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Focusing behavior of a few different lens types.",

    "text": "A magnifying glass has several applications. First of all, it allows to see objects with details that would otherwise be too small to be observed with the eye even of the eye lens can accomodate to the distances. Such magnifying glasses are also used in microscopes as the so-called eye-piece as we will later see in the section on microscopes.\nConsider the sketch below. The sketch shows an object of a size \\(A\\) which is at a distance of \\(s_0\\) from the eye. The object makes an angle \\(\\epsilon_0\\) with the optical axis. If we insert now a lens into the space between object and eye and the lens is positioned in a way that it is exactly at a distance \\(f\\) (the focal distance of the lens) from the object then we are able to observe the object under a different angle \\(\\epsilon\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig.: Magnifying glass at the focal distance.\n\n\n\nThe magnification of this magnifying glass can the be calculated from the angles \\(\\epsilon\\approx A/f\\) and \\(\\epsilon_0\\approx A/s_0\\):\n\\[\nV=\\frac{\\tan(\\epsilon)}{\\tan(\\epsilon_0)}\\approx \\frac{\\epsilon}{\\epsilon_0}=\\frac{A}{f}\\frac{s_0}{A}=\\frac{s_0}{f}.\n\\]\nThe angular magnification is, thus, just given by the ratio of the clear visual range to the focal distance of the lens. If the focal distance \\(f\\) becomes much smaller than \\(s_0\\), large magnifications are possible.\nA second very useful effect is that when the object is placed inside the focal distance from the lens, the eye images a virtual image at infinite distance to the retina (see sketch). This means the eye muscle can stay relaxed when observing the object, while it would otherwise probably have to accommodate to the distance.\nYet, placing the object at exactly the focal distance is rather tedious when holding the magnifying glass by hand. If the object is now placed inside the focal distance of the magnifying glass, we may also calculate a magnification in this case knowing the virtual image size \\(B\\) created in this case (see sketch below)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig.: Magnifying glass for an object inside the focal range of the lens.\n\n\n\nIf \\(a\\) is the distance of the object from the principle plane of the magnifying glass and \\(b\\) and \\(B\\) are the distance and the size of the virtual image, respectively, we obtain\n\\[\nV=\\frac{\\tan(\\epsilon)}{\\tan(\\epsilon_0)}\\approx \\frac{\\epsilon}{\\epsilon_0}=\\frac{B}{b}\\frac{s_0}{A}=\\frac{s_0}{a}.\n\\]\nUsing the imaging equation\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{f}=\\frac{1}{a}+\\frac{1}{b}\n\\]\nwe may finally arrive at\n\\[\nV=\\frac{s_0(b-f)}{b\\,f}\n\\]\nin this case. If we place the virtual image directly at the clear visual range, i.e., \\(b=-s_0\\), we find\n\\[\nV=\\frac{s_0}{f}+1.\n\\]"

    "text": "When light radiates from a point \\(P\\) and reflects off a mirror, as shown in the image, the reflected rays diverge but appear to originate from a point \\(P'\\) located behind the mirror. According to the law of reflection, this image point is positioned at the same distance behind the mirror as the original object point is in front of it. As a result, an observer receiving these reflected rays, such as on their retina, perceives the point as if it were situated behind the mirror, even though no light actually travels behind the mirror surface.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Image formation on a plane mirror.\n\n\n\nWhen multiple points of an object emit light towards the mirror, this principle applies to each point. As a result, the entire object appears as an image behind the mirror. Since each point of the image is equidistant from the mirror as its corresponding object point, the image has the same size as the object. This leads to the definition of magnification as:\n\\[\nM=\\frac{h_{\\text{image}}}{h_{\\text{object}}}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Image formation on a plane mirror.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirtual Images\n\n\n\nA virtual image is an optical illusion where light rays appear to come from a point, but don’t actually converge there. Unlike real images, virtual images can’t be projected onto a screen. They’re commonly seen in plane mirrors, convex mirrors, and when objects are closer to a lens than its focal point. Remember: for virtual images, light rays only seem to originate from the image when traced backwards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReal Images\n\n\n\nA real image forms when light rays actually meet at a point after reflection or refraction. These images can be projected onto a screen because light physically passes through the image location. Real images are often inverted and occur with concave mirrors and lenses when objects are beyond the focal point. Key point: real images involve actual convergence of light rays.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a concave mirror (where the reflecting surface is on the inside of the spherical curve), applying the law of reflection yields interesting results. Light rays parallel to the optical axis, at a distance \\(h\\) from it, are reflected towards the axis and intersect it at a specific point \\(F\\). Due to the mirror’s symmetry, a parallel ray on the opposite side of the axis will also converge to this same point \\(F\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Reflection of a parallel ray incident at a height \\(h\\) from the optical axis on a concave mirror.\n\n\n\nWe may calculate the position of the point \\(F\\), e.g. the distance from the mirror surface point \\(O\\), by applying the law of reflection. If the spherical mirror surface has a radius \\(R\\), then the distance between the center of the sphere \\(M\\) and the point \\(F\\) is given by\n\\[FM=\\frac{R}{2\\cos(\\alpha)}\\]\nTherefore, we can also calculate the distance of the mirror surafce from the point \\(F\\), which results in\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nOF=R\\left (1-\\frac{1}{2\\cos(\\alpha)}\\right)=f\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThis distance is the so-called focal length of the concave mirror \\(f\\). For small angle \\(\\alpha\\), the above equation yields the so called paraxial limit (all angles are small and the rays are close to the optical axis). In this limit we find \\(\\cos(\\alpha)\\approx 1\\) and the focal length becomes \\(f=R/2\\). If we replace the cosine function by \\(\\cos(\\alpha)=\\sqrt{1-sin^2(\\alpha)}\\) with \\(\\sin(\\alpha)=h/R\\), we find\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nf=R\\left [ 1-\\frac{R}{2\\sqrt{R^2-h^2}}\\right ]\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThis equation is telling us, that the focal distance is not a single value for a concave mirror. The focal distance rather changes with the distance \\(h\\) from the optical axis. If \\(h\\) approaches \\(R\\) the focal length become shorter.\nTo obtain now an equation which predicts the point at which the reflected ray intersects the optical axis if it emerged at a point \\(A\\), we just consider the following sketch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Image formation on a concave mirror.\n\n\n\nFor this situation, we can write down immediately the following relations\n\\[\\delta=\\alpha+\\gamma\\]\n\\[\\gamma+\\beta=2\\delta\\]\nFurther\n\\[\\tan(\\gamma)=\\frac{h}{g}\\approx \\gamma\\]\nand\n\\[\\tan(\\beta)=\\frac{h}{b}\\approx \\beta\\]\nand finally\n\\[\\sin(\\delta)=\\frac{h}{R}\\approx \\delta\\]\nfrom which we obtain the imaging equation\n\\[\\frac{1}{g}+\\frac{1}{b}\\approx \\frac{2}{R}\\approx \\frac{1}{f}\\]\nThis equation has some surprising property. It is completely independent of \\(h\\) and \\(\\gamma\\). That means all points in a plane at a distance \\(g\\) are images into a plane at a distance \\(b\\). Both planes are therefore called conjugated planes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImaging Equation Concave Mirror\n\n\n\nThe sum of the inverse object and image distances equals the inverse focal length of the cocave mirror.\n\\[\\frac{1}{g}+\\frac{1}{b}\\approx\\frac{1}{f}\\]\n\n\nThis equation now helps to construct the image of an object in front of a concave mirror and we may define 3 different rays to identify the size of an image \\(h_{\\text{image}}\\) from the size of an object \\(h_{\\text{object}}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Image formation on a concave mirror.\n\n\n\nIn the diagram above, three key rays are used to construct the image:\n\nRed ray: Parallel to optical axis → reflects through focal point\nGreen ray: Through focal point → reflects parallel to optical axis\nCentral ray: Through center of curvature → reflects back along same path\n\nThe behavior of these reflected rays determines the nature of the image:\n\nIf the rays intersect on the same side of the mirror as the object, a real image forms. This image is inverted, as shown in the sketch.\nIf the rays diverge after reflection, they appear to intersect behind the mirror, creating a virtual image. This image is upright and located behind the mirror, though no actual ray intersection occurs.\n\nThe point where these rays meet (or appear to meet) determines the image size. By drawing a ray from the object’s tip through the mirror’s center (point O), we can easily determine the image height h_image. As an exercise, consider how this construction demonstrates that the magnification of a concave mirror is given by\n\\[ \\frac{h_{\\text{image}}}{h_{\\text{image}}}=-\\frac{b}{g}=M\\]\nThis ratio indeed represents the magnification \\(M\\). The negative sign in the expression reflects an important optical property: for real images formed by concave mirrors, the image is inverted relative to the object. This inversion is mathematically represented by the negative magnification value. Conversely, a positive magnification would indicate an upright image, which occurs with virtual images.\nWith the help of the imaging equation and the magnification we may in general differentiate between the following general situations:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObject Distance\nImage Characteristics\nImage Position\nMagnification\n\n\n\n\n\\(g &gt; 2f\\)\nReal, inverted, smaller\nBetween f and 2f\n\\(|m|\\) &lt; 1\n\n\n\\(g = 2f\\)\nReal, inverted, same size\nAt 2f\n\\(|m|\\) = 1\n\n\n\\(f &lt; g &lt; 2f\\)\nReal, inverted, larger\nBeyond 2f\n\\(|m|\\) &gt; 1\n\n\n\\(g = f\\)\nImage at infinity\nAt infinity\nN/A\n\n\n\\(g &lt; f\\)\nVirtual, upright, larger\nBehind mirror\n\\(|m|\\) &gt; 1",

If the spherical mirror surface has a radius \\(R\\), then the distance between the center of the sphere \\(M\\) and the point \\(F\\) is given by\n\\[FM=\\frac{R}{2\\cos(\\alpha)}\\]\nTherefore, we can also calculate the distance of the mirror surafce from the point \\(F\\), which results in\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nOF=R\\left (1-\\frac{1}{2\\cos(\\alpha)}\\right)=f\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThis distance is the so-called focal length of the concave mirror \\(f\\). For small angle \\(\\alpha\\), the above equation yields the so called paraxial limit (all angles are small and the rays are close to the optical axis). In this limit we find \\(\\cos(\\alpha)\\approx 1\\) and the focal length becomes \\(f=R/2\\). If we replace the cosine function by \\(\\cos(\\alpha)=\\sqrt{1-sin^2(\\alpha)}\\) with \\(\\sin(\\alpha)=h/R\\), we find\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nf=R\\left [ 1-\\frac{R}{2\\sqrt{R^2-h^2}}\\right ]\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThis equation is telling us, that the focal distance is not a single value for a concave mirror. The focal distance rather changes with the distance \\(h\\) from the optical axis. If \\(h\\) approaches \\(R\\) the focal length become shorter.\nTo obtain now an equation which predicts the point at which the reflected ray intersects the optical axis if it emerged at a point \\(A\\), we just consider the following sketch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Image formation on a concave mirror.\n\n\n\nFor this situation, we can write down immediately the following relations\n\\[\\delta=\\alpha+\\gamma\\]\n\\[\\gamma+\\beta=2\\delta\\]\nFurther\n\\[\\tan(\\gamma)=\\frac{h}{g}\\approx \\gamma\\]\nand\n\\[\\tan(\\beta)=\\frac{h}{b}\\approx \\beta\\]\nand finally\n\\[\\sin(\\delta)=\\frac{h}{R}\\approx \\delta\\]\nfrom which we obtain the imaging equation\n\\[\\frac{1}{g}+\\frac{1}{b}\\approx \\frac{2}{R}\\approx \\frac{1}{f}\\]\nThis equation has some surprising property. It is completely independent of \\(h\\) and \\(\\gamma\\). That means all points in a plane at a distance \\(g\\) are images into a plane at a distance \\(b\\). Both planes are therefore called conjugated planes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImaging Equation Concave Mirror\n\n\n\nThe sum of the inverse object and image distances equals the inverse focal length of the cocave mirror.\n\\[\\frac{1}{g}+\\frac{1}{b}\\approx\\frac{1}{f}\\]\n\n\nThis equation now helps to construct the image of an object in front of a concave mirror and we may define 3 different rays to identify the size of an image \\(h_{\\text{image}}\\) from the size of an object \\(h_{\\text{object}}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Image formation on a concave mirror.\n\n\n\nIn the diagram above, three key rays are used to construct the image:\n\nRed ray: Parallel to optical axis → reflects through focal point\nGreen ray: Through focal point → reflects parallel to optical axis\nCentral ray: Through center of curvature → reflects back along same path\n\nThe behavior of these reflected rays determines the nature of the image:\n\nIf the rays intersect on the same side of the mirror as the object, a real image forms. This image is inverted, as shown in the sketch.\nIf the rays diverge after reflection, they appear to intersect behind the mirror, creating a virtual image. This image is upright and located behind the mirror, though no actual ray intersection occurs.\n\nThe point where these rays meet (or appear to meet) determines the image size. By drawing a ray from the object’s tip through the mirror’s center (point O), we can easily determine the image height h_image. As an exercise, consider how this construction demonstrates that the magnification of a concave mirror is given by\n\\[ \\frac{h_{\\text{image}}}{h_{\\text{image}}}=-\\frac{b}{g}=M\\]\nThis ratio indeed represents the magnification \\(M\\). The negative sign in the expression reflects an important optical property: for real images formed by concave mirrors, the image is inverted relative to the object. This inversion is mathematically represented by the negative magnification value. Conversely, a positive magnification would indicate an upright image, which occurs with virtual images.\nWith the help of the imaging equation and the magnification we may in general differentiate between the following general situations:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObject Distance\nImage Characteristics\nImage Position\nMagnification\n\n\n\n\n\\(g &gt; 2f\\)\nReal, inverted, smaller\nBetween f and 2f\n\\(|m|\\) &lt; 1\n\n\n\\(g = 2f\\)\nReal, inverted, same size\nAt 2f\n\\(|m|\\) = 1\n\n\n\\(f &lt; g &lt; 2f\\)\nReal, inverted, larger\nBeyond 2f\n\\(|m|\\) &gt; 1\n\n\n\\(g = f\\)\nImage at infinity\nAt infinity\nN/A\n\n\n\\(g &lt; f\\)\nVirtual, upright, larger\nBehind mirror\n\\(|m|\\) &gt; 1",

    "text": "Historical Context of Refraction\n\n\n\n\n\nThe understanding of refraction has evolved over centuries, with contributions from various cultures and scientific traditions. This timeline highlights key milestones in the discovery and formalization of refraction, showcasing how our comprehension of this fundamental optical phenomenon has deepened over time:\n\nAncient Greece (3rd century BCE):\n\nEuclid noticed that a stick partially submerged in water appears bent.\nArchimedes studied the refraction of light in water.\n\nAncient Rome (1st century CE):\n\nPtolemy conducted experiments on refraction and compiled tables of refraction angles for different media.\n\nIslamic Golden Age (10th-11th centuries):\n\nIbn Sahl (940-1000) discovered the law of refraction, describing it geometrically.\nAlhazen (965-1040) studied lenses and the human eye, contributing significantly to optics.\n\nMiddle Ages:\n\nRobert Grosseteste (1175-1253) and Roger Bacon (1214-1294) studied refraction and its application to lenses.\n\nRenaissance:\n\nThomas Harriot (1560-1621) rediscovered the law of refraction but didn’t publish his findings.\n\n17th Century:\n\nWillebrord Snellius (1580-1626) derived the mathematical law of refraction (Snell’s law) around 1621.\nRené Descartes (1596-1650) independently derived and published the law of refraction in 1637.\nPierre de Fermat (1607-1665) derived the law of refraction using his principle of least time.\n\n19th Century:\n\nAugustin-Jean Fresnel (1788-1827) developed the wave theory of light, explaining refraction in terms of changes in wave speed.\n\n20th Century:\n\nThe development of quantum mechanics provided a deeper understanding of the interaction between light and matter, further explaining the phenomenon of refraction.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe law of refraction is the second important law of geometrical optics. It relates the refractive index \\(n_1\\) and angle of incidence \\(\\theta_1\\) on one side of an interface to the refractive index \\(n_2\\) and angle of refraction \\(\\theta_2\\) on the other side. Both the law of reflection and the law of refraction can be derived from more fundamental principles such as Fermat’s principle of least time and are consistent with the conservation of energy. Their relation to momentum is more complex and involves considering the interaction of light with the medium at an atomic level. These laws provide a mathematical framework for predicting how light behaves when it encounters interfaces between different media, forming the basis for understanding a wide range of optical phenomena and the design of optical devices.\n\n\nThe refractive index \\(n\\) is a material constant representing the factor by which the speed of light is reduced in the medium compared to its speed in vacuum. For most natural materials and visible light, the refractive index is \\(n \\ge 1\\), as light typically travels slower in media than in vacuum. However, in certain special cases—such as for X-rays in some materials or in engineered metamaterials—the refractive index can be less than 1 or even negative. Understanding these exotic cases requires a deeper exploration of the electromagnetic properties of materials and the origin of the refractive index, which we will address later.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaw of Refraction (Snell’s Law)\n\n\n\nThe law of refraction (Snell’s law) is given for the above sketch by the equation:\n\\[\nn_1 \\sin(\\theta_1)=n_2 \\sin(\\theta_2)\n\\]\n\n\nYou can explore the law of refraction using the interactive visualization below. The visualization shows a light ray incident on an interface between two media with different refractive indices. You can adjust the angle of incidence and the refractive index of the first medium to see how the angle of refraction changes according to Snell’s law.\n\n\n\nIncident Angle: 45°\n\nRefractive Index: 1.0\n\n\n\n\nSnell’s law leads to some general patterns in the behavior of light rays at interfaces, which are worth remembering. Consider these two cases:\n\nWhen light moves from a medium with lower refractive index to one with higher refractive index (\\(n_1 &lt; n_2\\)):\n\nThe refracted ray bends towards the normal (optical axis)\nThe angle of refraction is smaller than the angle of incidence (\\(\\theta_2 &lt; \\theta_1\\))\n\nWhen light moves from a medium with higher refractive index to one with lower refractive index (\\(n_1 &gt; n_2\\)):\n\nThe refracted ray bends away from the normal (optical axis)\nThe angle of refraction is larger than the angle of incidence (\\(\\theta_2 &gt; \\theta_1\\))\n\n\nFigure 2.1 illustrates these principles with three plots showing how the refracted angle changes with the incident angle for two common interface scenarios: glass-to-air and air-to-glass. These plots clearly demonstrate the different behaviors described above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1— Snell’s law for different combinations of refractive indices. The plots show the relationship between incident angle (\\(\\theta_1\\)) and refracted angle (\\(\\theta_2\\)) for three scenarios: (a) light passing from air to glass, (b) light passing from glass to air, and (c) a comparison of both cases. Note how the curves differ when light moves into a medium with higher refractive index versus a lower refractive index.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above diagram reveals a special case occurring when \\(n_1 &gt; n_2\\). Under these conditions, we can increase the incident angle \\(\\theta_1\\) until the outgoing angle reaches \\(\\theta_2 = \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\). At this point, the refracted ray would be traveling along the interface between the two media. For any incident angle \\(\\theta_1\\) larger than this critical angle, there is no refracted ray at all; instead, we observe only a reflected ray. This phenomenon, known as total internal reflection, occurs despite the fact that the material with refractive index \\(n_2\\) is completely transparent.\nLet’s formalize this concept mathematically. Using Snell’s law and setting \\(\\theta_2 = \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\), we obtain the equation for the critical angle \\(\\theta_c\\):\n\\[\\theta_1 = \\theta_c = \\sin^{-1}\\left(\\frac{n_2}{n_1}\\right)\\]\nNote that the \\(\\sin^{-1}()\\) function requires an argument \\(\\le 1\\), which is why this phenomenon only occurs when \\(n_2 &lt; n_1\\).\nIt’s important to understand that during total internal reflection, all of the light energy is reflected back into the first medium, hence the term ‘total’. However, electromagnetic optics reveals an interesting subtlety: an evanescent wave penetrates a short distance into the second medium, though it doesn’t propagate energy across the boundary.\nWhen the incident angle exceeds the critical angle, Snell’s law as we’ve written it no longer applies. Instead, we observe perfect reflection, where the angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence, just as in regular reflection from a mirror. This reflection occurs without any loss of energy to the second medium, making it an extremely efficient process.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Internal Reflection\n\n\n\nTotal internal reflection occurs when light is passing from higher refractive index to lower refractive index materials for incidence angle larger than a critical angle\n\\[\n\\theta_c=\\sin^{-1}\\left (\\frac{n_2}{n_1}\\right )\n\\]\n\n\nWe can demonstrate total internal reflection very easily with a water basin, for example, where we couple in light from a laser from the side.\n \nBut you could try that yourself also in the bath tub diving below the water surface.\nTotal internal reflection has numerous practical applications:\n\nFiber optic communications: Light signals can travel long distances with minimal loss through optical fibers.\nOptical instruments: Prisms in binoculars and telescopes use total internal reflection to manipulate light paths.\nGemstones: The sparkle of diamonds is enhanced by total internal reflection trapping light within the stone.\nMedical endoscopes: Total internal reflection helps guide light through flexible tubes for internal imaging.\n\nOptical Fibers and Total Internal Reflection\nTotal internal reflection plays a crucial role in modern telecommunications, particularly in optical fibers, which are also part of many experimental setups. These fibers are essentially ultra-thin glass wires, ranging in diameter from a few micrometers to several hundred micrometers, designed to transport light over long distances with minimal loss.\nThe structure of an optical fiber is key to its function:\n\nCore: A central glass core with a refractive index \\(n_1\\)\nCladding: A surrounding layer with a slightly lower refractive index \\(n_2\\)\n\nThis difference in refractive indices is what allows total internal reflection to occur within the fiber.\n \nFor light to propagate effectively through the fiber, it must enter at an angle that ensures total internal reflection at the core-cladding interface. This leads to the concept of the acceptance angle, \\(\\theta_a\\), which is the maximum angle at which light can enter the fiber and still undergo total internal reflection.\nTo characterize this acceptance angle, optical engineers use a parameter called the Numerical Aperture (NA). The NA is defined as the sine of the maximum acceptance angle:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nNA = \\sin(\\theta_a) = \\sqrt{n_1^2 - n_2^2}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThis equation relates the NA directly to the refractive indices of the core and cladding. The derivation of this formula involves applying Snell’s law at the air-fiber interface and at the core-cladding interface, then using the condition for total internal reflection.\nIn practice, typical values for the refractive indices might be \\(n_1 = 1.475\\) for the core and \\(n_2 = 1.46\\) for the cladding. Plugging these into our equation:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nNA = \\sqrt{1.475^2 - 1.46^2} \\approx 0.2\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThis means that light entering the fiber within a cone of about 11.5° (arcsin(0.2)) from the fiber’s axis will be transmitted through the fiber via total internal reflection.\nThe NA is an important parameter in fiber optic design:\n\nIt determines the light-gathering ability of the fiber.\nIt affects the fiber’s bandwidth and its susceptibility to certain types of signal distortion.\nIt influences how easily the fiber can be coupled to light sources and other fibers.\n\nOptical fibers come in various types, each optimized for different applications. Some fibers are designed to transmit light over long distances with minimal loss, while others are engineered for specific wavelengths or to guide light in unusual ways. The figure below shows a few examples of optical fiber types.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2— Rendering of different optical fibers types (from left to right): Hollow core optical fiber, hollow core bragg fiber, photonic crystal fiber, conventional fiber",

This timeline highlights key milestones in the discovery and formalization of refraction, showcasing how our comprehension of this fundamental optical phenomenon has deepened over time:\n\nAncient Greece (3rd century BCE):\n\nEuclid noticed that a stick partially submerged in water appears bent.\nArchimedes studied the refraction of light in water.\n\nAncient Rome (1st century CE):\n\nPtolemy conducted experiments on refraction and compiled tables of refraction angles for different media.\n\nIslamic Golden Age (10th-11th centuries):\n\nIbn Sahl (940-1000) discovered the law of refraction, describing it geometrically.\nAlhazen (965-1040) studied lenses and the human eye, contributing significantly to optics.\n\nMiddle Ages:\n\nRobert Grosseteste (1175-1253) and Roger Bacon (1214-1294) studied refraction and its application to lenses.\n\nRenaissance:\n\nThomas Harriot (1560-1621) rediscovered the law of refraction but didn’t publish his findings.\n\n17th Century:\n\nWillebrord Snellius (1580-1626) derived the mathematical law of refraction (Snell’s law) around 1621.\nRené Descartes (1596-1650) independently derived and published the law of refraction in 1637.\nPierre de Fermat (1607-1665) derived the law of refraction using his principle of least time.\n\n19th Century:\n\nAugustin-Jean Fresnel (1788-1827) developed the wave theory of light, explaining refraction in terms of changes in wave speed.\n\n20th Century:\n\nThe development of quantum mechanics provided a deeper understanding of the interaction between light and matter, further explaining the phenomenon of refraction.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe law of refraction is the second important law of geometrical optics. It relates the refractive index \\(n_1\\) and angle of incidence \\(\\theta_1\\) on one side of an interface to the refractive index \\(n_2\\) and angle of refraction \\(\\theta_2\\) on the other side. Both the law of reflection and the law of refraction can be derived from more fundamental principles such as Fermat’s principle of least time and are consistent with the conservation of energy. Their relation to momentum is more complex and involves considering the interaction of light with the medium at an atomic level. These laws provide a mathematical framework for predicting how light behaves when it encounters interfaces between different media, forming the basis for understanding a wide range of optical phenomena and the design of optical devices.\n\n\nThe refractive index \\(n\\) is a material constant representing the factor by which the speed of light is reduced in the medium compared to its speed in vacuum. For most natural materials and visible light, the refractive index is \\(n \\ge 1\\), as light typically travels slower in media than in vacuum. However, in certain special cases—such as for X-rays in some materials or in engineered metamaterials—the refractive index can be less than 1 or even negative. Understanding these exotic cases requires a deeper exploration of the electromagnetic properties of materials and the origin of the refractive index, which we will address later.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaw of Refraction (Snell’s Law)\n\n\n\nThe law of refraction (Snell’s law) is given for the above sketch by the equation:\n\\[\nn_1 \\sin(\\theta_1)=n_2 \\sin(\\theta_2)\n\\]\n\n\nYou can explore the law of refraction using the interactive visualization below. The visualization shows a light ray incident on an interface between two media with different refractive indices. You can adjust the angle of incidence and the refractive index of the first medium to see how the angle of refraction changes according to Snell’s law.\n\n\n\nIncident Angle: 45°\n\nRefractive Index: 1.0\n\n\n\n\nSnell’s law leads to some general patterns in the behavior of light rays at interfaces, which are worth remembering. Consider these two cases:\n\nWhen light moves from a medium with lower refractive index to one with higher refractive index (\\(n_1 &lt; n_2\\)):\n\nThe refracted ray bends towards the normal (optical axis)\nThe angle of refraction is smaller than the angle of incidence (\\(\\theta_2 &lt; \\theta_1\\))\n\nWhen light moves from a medium with higher refractive index to one with lower refractive index (\\(n_1 &gt; n_2\\)):\n\nThe refracted ray bends away from the normal (optical axis)\nThe angle of refraction is larger than the angle of incidence (\\(\\theta_2 &gt; \\theta_1\\))\n\n\nFigure 2.1 illustrates these principles with three plots showing how the refracted angle changes with the incident angle for two common interface scenarios: glass-to-air and air-to-glass. These plots clearly demonstrate the different behaviors described above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1— Snell’s law for different combinations of refractive indices. The plots show the relationship between incident angle (\\(\\theta_1\\)) and refracted angle (\\(\\theta_2\\)) for three scenarios: (a) light passing from air to glass, (b) light passing from glass to air, and (c) a comparison of both cases. Note how the curves differ when light moves into a medium with higher refractive index versus a lower refractive index.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above diagram reveals a special case occurring when \\(n_1 &gt; n_2\\). Under these conditions, we can increase the incident angle \\(\\theta_1\\) until the outgoing angle reaches \\(\\theta_2 = \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\). At this point, the refracted ray would be traveling along the interface between the two media. For any incident angle \\(\\theta_1\\) larger than this critical angle, there is no refracted ray at all; instead, we observe only a reflected ray. This phenomenon, known as total internal reflection, occurs despite the fact that the material with refractive index \\(n_2\\) is completely transparent.\nLet’s formalize this concept mathematically. Using Snell’s law and setting \\(\\theta_2 = \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\), we obtain the equation for the critical angle \\(\\theta_c\\):\n\\[\\theta_1 = \\theta_c = \\sin^{-1}\\left(\\frac{n_2}{n_1}\\right)\\]\nNote that the \\(\\sin^{-1}()\\) function requires an argument \\(\\le 1\\), which is why this phenomenon only occurs when \\(n_2 &lt; n_1\\).\nIt’s important to understand that during total internal reflection, all of the light energy is reflected back into the first medium, hence the term ‘total’. However, electromagnetic optics reveals an interesting subtlety: an evanescent wave penetrates a short distance into the second medium, though it doesn’t propagate energy across the boundary.\nWhen the incident angle exceeds the critical angle, Snell’s law as we’ve written it no longer applies. Instead, we observe perfect reflection, where the angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence, just as in regular reflection from a mirror. This reflection occurs without any loss of energy to the second medium, making it an extremely efficient process.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Internal Reflection\n\n\n\nTotal internal reflection occurs when light is passing from higher refractive index to lower refractive index materials for incidence angle larger than a critical angle\n\\[\n\\theta_c=\\sin^{-1}\\left (\\frac{n_2}{n_1}\\right )\n\\]\n\n\nWe can demonstrate total internal reflection very easily with a water basin, for example, where we couple in light from a laser from the side.\n \nBut you could try that yourself also in the bath tub diving below the water surface.\nTotal internal reflection has numerous practical applications:\n\nFiber optic communications: Light signals can travel long distances with minimal loss through optical fibers.\nOptical instruments: Prisms in binoculars and telescopes use total internal reflection to manipulate light paths.\nGemstones: The sparkle of diamonds is enhanced by total internal reflection trapping light within the stone.\nMedical endoscopes: Total internal reflection helps guide light through flexible tubes for internal imaging.\n\nOptical Fibers and Total Internal Reflection\nTotal internal reflection plays a crucial role in modern telecommunications, particularly in optical fibers, which are also part of many experimental setups. These fibers are essentially ultra-thin glass wires, ranging in diameter from a few micrometers to several hundred micrometers, designed to transport light over long distances with minimal loss.\nThe structure of an optical fiber is key to its function:\n\nCore: A central glass core with a refractive index \\(n_1\\)\nCladding: A surrounding layer with a slightly lower refractive index \\(n_2\\)\n\nThis difference in refractive indices is what allows total internal reflection to occur within the fiber.\n \nFor light to propagate effectively through the fiber, it must enter at an angle that ensures total internal reflection at the core-cladding interface. This leads to the concept of the acceptance angle, \\(\\theta_a\\), which is the maximum angle at which light can enter the fiber and still undergo total internal reflection.\nTo characterize this acceptance angle, optical engineers use a parameter called the Numerical Aperture (NA). The NA is defined as the sine of the maximum acceptance angle:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nNA = \\sin(\\theta_a) = \\sqrt{n_1^2 - n_2^2}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThis equation relates the NA directly to the refractive indices of the core and cladding. The derivation of this formula involves applying Snell’s law at the air-fiber interface and at the core-cladding interface, then using the condition for total internal reflection.\nIn practice, typical values for the refractive indices might be \\(n_1 = 1.475\\) for the core and \\(n_2 = 1.46\\) for the cladding. Plugging these into our equation:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nNA = \\sqrt{1.475^2 - 1.46^2} \\approx 0.2\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThis means that light entering the fiber within a cone of about 11.5° (arcsin(0.2)) from the fiber’s axis will be transmitted through the fiber via total internal reflection.\nThe NA is an important parameter in fiber optic design:\n\nIt determines the light-gathering ability of the fiber.\nIt affects the fiber’s bandwidth and its susceptibility to certain types of signal distortion.\nIt influences how easily the fiber can be coupled to light sources and other fibers.\n\nOptical fibers come in various types, each optimized for different applications. Some fibers are designed to transmit light over long distances with minimal loss, while others are engineered for specific wavelengths or to guide light in unusual ways. The figure below shows a few examples of optical fiber types.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2— Rendering of different optical fibers types (from left to right): Hollow core optical fiber, hollow core bragg fiber, photonic crystal fiber, conventional fiber",

So both angles are the same for the reflection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaw of Reflection\n\n\n\nIf a ray is incident to a reflecting surface under an angle \\(\\theta_1\\) it will be reflected towards under an angle \\(\\theta_2=\\theta_1\\) to the same side of the surface.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe law of reflection can be actually obtained from a variational principle saying the light rays propagate along those path on which the propagation time is an extremum. This variational principle is called Fermat’s principle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3— Sketch for deriving the law of reflection from Fermat’s principle\n\n\n\nConsider now a light ray that should travel from point \\(A\\) to point \\(C\\) via a point \\(B\\) on the mirror surface. In general multiple paths are possible such as the one indicated in the above picture. Clearly this path is not satisfying our reflection law formulated above.

The total length the light hast to travel via the three points is\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nl=l_{1}+l_{2}=\\sqrt{(x-x_1)^2+y_1^2}+\\sqrt{(x_2-x)^2+y_2^2}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThe time that is required by the light to travel that distance \\(l\\) is then given by\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nt=\\frac{l}{c},\n\\end{equation}\\]\nwhere \\(c\\) is the speed of light in the medium above the mirror. If this time should now be a minimum, we have to take the derivative of the time \\(t\\) with respect to the position \\(x\\) on the mirror and set that to zero, i.e.,\n\\[\\frac{\\mathrm dt}{\\mathrm dx}=0. \\tag{1.1}\\]\nThis results in Eq. 1.1 \\[\\begin{equation}\n\\frac{x-x_1}{\\sqrt{(x-x_1)^2+y_{1}^2}}=\\frac{x_2-x}{\\sqrt{(x_2-x)^2+y_{2}^2}},\n\\end{equation}\\]\nwhich is actually\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\frac{x-x_1}{l_1}=\\frac{x_2-x}{l_2}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nor\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\sin(\\theta_1)=\\sin(\\theta_2)\n\\end{equation}\\]\nwhich finally requires\n\\[\\theta_1=\\theta_2\\]\nand is our law of reflection.

A more detailed sketch is depicted on the right side, which shows the arrangement of rods and cones in the retina including their parallel connection. Their combined signal is ending the optical nerves guiding the signals to the brain.\n\n\n\nMost important is the pupil resembling an adjustable aperture for adjusting the total light falling to the retina and the lens, connected to muscles to change the curvature of the lens and, thus, also the focal distance.\nThe lens is connected to air on one side as the surrounding medium and to a vitreous humor (glass body) on the other side. So there is some asymmetry. The eye, therefore, has a front focal length of \\(f_1=17\\,{\\rm mm}\\) and a back focal length of \\(f_2=22\\,{\\rm mm}\\). These values may vary by the individual but also by the distance of the object. For close objects the eye can accomodate its focal distance to \\(f_1=14\\,{\\rm mm}\\) and \\(f_2=19\\,{\\rm mm}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig.: Focal distances for the eye lens.\n\n\n\nCones and rods are differently distributed around the fovea, which is the spot of the highest color sensitivity. The cone density peaks around this center, while the rod density is larger outside. Cones are the color sensitive objects, which gain their light sensitive from a dye molecules called retinal undergoing a conformational transition upon excitation with light. This triggers a cascasde of different chemical processes. Cones with three narrow excitation ranges allow our color vision (see Fig. below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig.: Angular distribution of cones and rods around the fovea, electron micrograph of cones (large) and rods (small) as well as their color sensitivity.\n\n\n\nUnder normal conditions, objects at infinite distance are imaged to the retina at the back focal distance \\(f_2=22\\, {\\rm mm}\\). However, the lens of the eye may have defects changing its refractive power. Often this leads to short-sightedness or far-sightedness. If you are short-sighted, the light from infinite distance is not focused to the retina but to some shorter distance inside the glass body. This may be corrected by a concave lens as displayed in the image below on the left side. If you are far-sighted, then the light is focused behind the retina if objects are ininitely distant away. To correct for that error, one needs a convex lens as displayed on the right side.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFig.: Short-sightedness (left) and far-sightedness (right) and their correction by additional lenses.\n\n\n\nIn the normal relaxed state of the eye muscle, one can, therefore, observe objects up to a distance of \\(s_0=25\\, {\\rm cm}\\) without additional accomodation of the eye lens. This distance, which varies from person to person, is standardized and called the range of clear visual sight. This range of clear visual sight allows to observe objects under an angle \\(\\epsilon\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig.: Short-sightedness (left) and far-sightedness (right) and their correction by additional lenses.\n\n\n\nInstead of calculating the magnification of the following optical instruments from the object and image distances, we refer now to a different measure, which is the angular magnification. The angular magnification is given by\n\\[\nV=\\frac{\\tan(\\epsilon)}{\\tan(\\epsilon_0)}\\approx \\frac{\\epsilon}{\\epsilon_0}.\n\\]\nThis is a useful measure as the image size is not really accessible ;-)."

We will explore the rainbow and in addition a DIY version, the glassbow. To understand the rainbow we will have first a look at the reflection of rays from a single droplet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig.: Reflection of rays in a single drop.\n\n\n\nIn the sketch above a light ray of white light is entering the droplet under an angle \\(\\alpha\\) to the surface normal on the top. The ray is refracted and enters the droplet under an angle \\(\\beta\\) to the surface normal. The angle can be calculated from Snell’s law\n\\[n_{\\rm air}\\sin(\\alpha)=n_{\\rm water}\\sin(\\beta).\\]\nInside the droplet, the ray is now hitting the water/air surface at the backside from which it gets reflected. There, the incident angle is also \\(\\beta\\) and the ray is reflected under an angle \\(\\beta\\) as well. At that point, most of the light will, however, exit the drop on the backside, so that only a small fraction is reflected and traveling further to hit a second time the water/air surface at the angle \\(\\beta\\). The light refracted out at that point leaves the droplet under an angle \\(\\alpha\\) with the surface normal due to the reversiblity of the light path. We are, however, interested in the angle \\(\\phi\\) that the ray makes with the incident direction.\nThis angle \\(\\phi\\) can be calculated from the above sketch to be\n\\[\\phi=4\\beta-2\\alpha.\\]\nSince\n\\[\\beta=\\sin^{-1}\\left (\\frac{n_{\\rm air}}{n_{\\rm water}}\\sin(\\alpha) \\right)\\]\nsuch that finally\n\\[\\phi=4\\sin^{-1}\\left (\\frac{n_{\\rm air}}{n_{\\rm water}}\\sin(\\alpha) \\right)-2\\alpha\\]\nSo let us have a look at this dependence of the deflection angle as a function of the incidence angle.\n\nalpha=np.linspace(0,np.pi/2,10000)\nh2o=pd.read_csv(\"data/H2O.csv\",delimiter=\",\")\nn=np.interp(0.500,h2o.wl,h2o.n)\n\n\ndef rainbow(alpha,n):\n    return(4*np.arcsin(np.sin(alpha)/n)-2*alpha)\n\n\nplt.plot(alpha*180/np.pi,rainbow(alpha,n)*180/np.pi)\nplt.xlabel(r\"incident angle $\\alpha$ [°]\")\nplt.ylabel(r\"deflection angle $\\phi$ [°]\")\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dependence seems to show a maximum deflection angle at an incidence angle of around \\(\\alpha=60^{\\circ}\\). This is an important finding, as the whole appearance of the rainbow depends on that.\n\nprint('Maximum deflection angle ', np.max(rainbow(alpha,n)*180/np.pi))\n\nMaximum deflection angle  41.78815648670841\n\n\n\n\nColor of the rainbow\nThe color of the rainbow is now the result of the fact that the maximum deflection angle depends on the color of the light due to the dispersion. Since we have a refraction, reflection and another refraction, the largest maximum deflection angle is observed for red light, while the smallest one appears for blue light. The diagrams below show this result, which is in general true for materials with normal dispersion.\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(12,4))\nplt.subplot(1,2,1)\nfor wl in np.linspace(0.400,0.700,100): \n    c=wavelength_to_rgb(wl*1000, gamma=0.8)\n    n=np.interp(wl,h2o.wl,h2o.n)\n    plt.plot(alpha*180/np.pi,rainbow(alpha,n)*180/np.pi,c=c,alpha=1,lw=1)\nplt.xlabel(r\"incident angle $\\alpha$ [°]\")\nplt.ylabel(r\"deflection angle $\\phi$ [°]\")\n\n\n\nplt.subplot(1,2,2)\nfor wl in np.linspace(0.400,0.700,100): \n    c=wavelength_to_rgb(wl*1000, gamma=0.8)\n    n=np.interp(wl,h2o.wl,h2o.n)\n    plt.plot(alpha*180/np.pi,rainbow(alpha,n)*180/np.pi,c=c,alpha=1,lw=1)\nplt.xlabel(r\"incident angle $\\alpha$ [°]\")\nplt.ylabel(r\"deflection angle $\\phi$ [°]\")\nplt.xlim(45,70)\nplt.ylim(40,43)\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis order of the colors is actually true for all incident angles, which raises the question, why the rainbow is actually colored. The blue color of a certain incidence angle would actually overlap with the green color of a different incidence angle and the red color of an even different incidence angle. If you select a specific outgoing angle under which you observe the rainbow, let us say 41°, then you find under this observation angle all color and, therefore, should observe always white light.\nThis is actually true if you look at the inside of a rainbow. You clearly recognize that inside the rainbow it is much brighter than outside. Yet when you reach the maximum angle of each color, you have a region, where even for larger angles for the incidence angles, the deflection angle does not change. Thus, if you assume you send in rays at constantly spaced incidence angles, you will have more rays with a deflection angle close to the maximum. The diagram below just counts the number of deflection angles in the different for each color and you clearly see that around the maximum deflection angles for each color you have a strong peak.\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(5,6))\nfor wl in np.linspace(0.400,0.700,4): \n    c=wavelength_to_rgb(wl*1000, gamma=0.8)\n    n=np.interp(wl,h2o.wl,h2o.n)\n    plt.hist(rainbow(alpha,n)*180/np.pi,bins=200,color=c,alpha=0.6,lw=1);\nplt.xlabel(r\"deflection angle $\\alpha$ [°]\")\nplt.ylabel(r\"intensity [a.u.]\")\n\nplt.xlim(30,45)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThus, around each droplet on the sky, there is a cone of deflected light reflected back from the sun. On the outside of that cone is red light under an angle of almost \\(42^{\\circ}\\) while on the inside edge we find blue light and finally white light (see left image below). We just have to connect that to the observer now. This is shown in the right sketch. The rainbow, therefore, results from the fact that we look at different height at different edges of the cone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFig.: Deflection cones of different color on a single drop in a rainbow and rainbow as a result of the observation of the cones.\n\n\n\n\nRainbow\nThe photos below show a rainbow, where you should see the enhanced white color in the center of the rainbow, the color order of the bow itself and the darker region outside. But there is also a second rainbow appearing on the outside.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig.: Double rainbow over the Grand Canyon. (c) Picture by Frank Cichos\n\n\n\nThis second outside rainbow has a reversed color order and is weaker than the inside rainbow. This secondary rainbow comes from a process involving two refractions and two reflections inside each drop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig.: Zoom into the rainbow over the Grand Canyon. (c) Picture by Frank Cichos\n\n\n\n\n\nGlassbow\nYou can observe a beautiful rainbow at home if you just have a few glass beads. You can get these glass beeds from us. They have a diameter of about 200 µm. If you place them on a black background and use a flash lamp, you will observe a nice rainbow as Mr. Märcker did in the photo below. The main difference is the observation angle. Try to calculate the new observation angle for the refractive indices of glass.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig.: Reflection of rays in a single drop.

    "text": "Prism\nPrisms are wedge-shaped optical elements made of a transparent material, such as glass. A special form of such a prism is an isosceles prism with two sides of equal length. The two equal sides enclose an angle \\(\\gamma\\), known as the apex angle of the prism. When light passes through this prism, it undergoes refraction twice.\nFirst, the incident angle \\(\\alpha_1\\) is changed into a refracted angle \\(\\beta_1\\) as the light enters the prism. This refracted ray then hits the second interface at an angle \\(\\beta_2\\), leading to a second refraction as it exits the prism at an angle \\(\\alpha_2\\).\nOf particular interest is the total deflection of the incident ray, which is measured by the angle \\(\\delta\\). This deflection angle represents the difference between the final outgoing angle \\(\\alpha_2\\) and the initial incident angle \\(\\alpha_1\\).\nUnderstanding how this deflection angle changes based on the prism’s properties and the incident angle is crucial in various optical applications. In the following sections, we will explore how to calculate this deflection angle and examine its dependence on different parameters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Refraction of rays on a prism.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Deflection angle as a function of the incidence angle for different prism angles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMinimum deflection angle\nIf we now would like to know how the deflection angle changes with the incident angle \\(\\alpha_1\\), we calculate the derivative of the deflection angle \\(\\delta\\) with respect to \\(\\alpha_1\\), i.e.,\n\\[\\frac{\\mathrm d\\delta}{\\mathrm d\\alpha_1}=1+\\frac{\\mathrm d\\alpha_2}{\\mathrm d \\alpha_1}.\\]\nWe are here especially interested in the case, where this change in deflection is reaching a minimum, i.e., \\(\\mathrm d\\delta/\\mathrm d\\alpha_1 =0\\). This readily yields\n\\[\\mathrm d \\alpha_2=-\\mathrm d\\alpha_1.\\]\nThis means a change in the incidence angle \\(\\mathrm d\\alpha_1\\) yields an opposite change in the outgoing angle \\(-\\mathrm d\\alpha_2\\). We may later observe that in the experiment.\nAs both, the incident and the outgoing angle are related to each other by Snells’s law, we may introduce the derivatives of Snell’s law for both interfaces, e.g.,\n\n\\(\\cos(\\alpha_1)\\mathrm d\\alpha_1=n\\cos(\\beta_1)\\mathrm d\\beta_1\\)\n\\(\\cos(\\alpha_2)\\mathrm d\\alpha_2=n\\cos(\\beta_2)\\mathrm d\\beta_2\\)\n\nwhere \\(n\\) is the refractive index of the prism material and the material outside is air (\\(n_{\\rm air}=1\\)). Replacing \\(\\cos(\\alpha)=\\sqrt{1-\\sin^2(\\alpha)}\\) and dividing the two previous equations by each other readily yields\n\\[\\frac{1-\\sin^2(\\alpha_1)}{1-\\sin^2(\\alpha_2)}=\\frac{n^2-\\sin^2(\\alpha_1)}{n^2-\\sin^2(\\alpha_2)}.\\]\nThe latter equation is for \\(n\\neq 1\\) only satisfied if \\(\\alpha_1=\\alpha_2=\\alpha\\). In this case, the light path through the prism must be symmetric and we may write down the minimum deflection angle \\(\\delta_{\\rm min}\\):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMinimum prism deflection\n\n\n\nThe minimum deflection angle of an isosceles prism with a prism angle \\(\\gamma\\) is given by\n\\[\\delta_{\\rm min}=2\\alpha-\\gamma.\\]\n\n\nIn this case, we may also write down Snell’s law using \\(\\sin(\\alpha)=n\\sin(\\beta)\\), which results in\n\\[\\sin \\left ( \\frac{\\delta_{\\rm min}+\\gamma}{2}\\right )=n\\sin\\left (\\frac{\\gamma}{2}\\right).\\]\n\n\nDispersion\nVery important applications now arise from the fact, that the refractive index is a material property, which depends on the color (frequency or wavelength) of light. We do not yet understand the origin of this dependence. The plots below show the wavelength dependence of three different glasses. You may find much more data on the refractive index of different materials in an online database.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Refractive index of different glasses as a function of the wavelength.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Deflection angle as a function of the incidence angle for different wavelengths.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plots have a general feature, which is that the refractive index is largest at small wavelength (blue colors), while it drops continuously with increasing wavelength towards the red (800 nm). If you would characterize the dependence by the slope, i.e., \\(\\mathrm dn/\\mathrm d\\lambda\\) then all displayed curves show in the visible range\n\n\\(\\frac{\\mathrm dn}{\\mathrm d\\lambda}&lt;0\\), is called normal dispersion\n\nwhile\n\n\\(\\frac{\\mathrm dn}{\\mathrm d\\lambda}&gt;0\\), is called anomalous dispersion\n\nThis wavelength dependence of the refractive index will yield a dependence of the deflection angle on the color of light as well. The change of the deflection angle with the refractive index can be calculated to be\n\\[\\frac{\\mathrm d\\delta}{\\mathrm d n}=\\frac{2\\sin(\\gamma/2)}{\\sqrt{1-n^2\\sin^2(\\gamma/2)}}\\]\ntogether with the relation\n\\[\\frac{\\mathrm d \\delta}{\\mathrm d \\lambda}=\\frac{\\mathrm d\\delta}{\\mathrm d n}\\frac{\\mathrm d n}{\\mathrm d\\lambda}\\]\nwe obtain\n\\[\\frac{\\mathrm d\\delta}{\\mathrm d\\lambda}=\\frac{2\\sin(\\gamma/2)}{\\sqrt{1-n^2\\sin^2(\\gamma/2)}}\\frac{\\mathrm d n}{\\mathrm d \\lambda}.\\]\nThe refraction of white light through a prism splits the different colors composing white light spatially into a colored spectrum. In this process, light with the longest wavelength (red) is deflected the least, while light with the shortest wavelength (violet) is deflected the most. This occurs because the refractive index of the prism material varies with wavelength, a phenomenon known as dispersion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Spectrum as created by a prism in the lecture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Spectrum\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Prism\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Deflection of different wavelengths of light in a prism with normal dispersion.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrims spectrograph\nThis wavelength-dependent refraction is crucial as it forms the basis for spectroscopy, a powerful analytical technique that measures and records the intensity of light as a function of wavelength. Spectroscopy allows scientists to analyze the composition and properties of matter by examining its interaction with light across different wavelengths.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Principle of a prism spectrometer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Technical realization of a prism spectrometer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Principle and technical realization of a prism spectrometer.\n\n\n\nDIY prism\nIf you don’t have a prism at home (which most people don’t), you can create a simple substitute using a mirror and a basin of water. Here’s how:\n\nPlace a mirror in a basin of water, partially submerged.\nShine white light from a flashlight onto the mirror.\nObserve the reflected and refracted light, paying special attention to the edges.\n\nFor better results, you can create a small aperture by making a tiny hole in a piece of black paper and placing it in front of the flashlight.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Home made water prism.\n\n\n\nWhile the dependence of water’s refractive index on wavelength is relatively weak, it’s still sufficient to demonstrate the familiar colors of the rainbow. This phenomenon will be referenced later in our discussion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Refractive index of water as a function of the wavelength.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplications of prims\n\n\n\n\n\nPrisms are versatile optical components with a wide range of applications across various fields. Here are some common uses of prisms:\n\nBinoculars and Telescopes: Porro prisms in traditional binoculars and roof prisms in modern designs serve to correct image inversion and provide a compact form. These prisms enable a longer optical path within a shorter physical length, enhancing magnification while maintaining portability. This design is crucial for both binoculars and some telescopes, offering users powerful magnification in a handheld device.\nPeriscopes: Right-angle prisms are the key component in periscopes, redirecting light at 90-degree angles. This simple yet effective design allows viewers to see over obstacles or around corners, making periscopes invaluable in submarines and various military applications where direct line of sight is obstructed.\nBeam Splitting: Cube beamsplitters play a vital role in dividing a single beam of light into two separate beams. This capability is essential in various scientific and medical applications, including interferometry, holography, and optical coherence tomography (OCT). The ability to split light beams precisely opens up numerous possibilities in research and diagnostics.\nBeam Steering: Risley prisms, consisting of a pair of rotating wedge prisms, offer precise control over laser beam direction. This technology finds applications in laser scanning, target tracking, and adaptive optics. The ability to steer beams accurately is crucial in fields ranging from military applications to advanced scientific research.\nDigital Projectors: Total Internal Reflection (TIR) prisms are a crucial component in Digital Light Processing (DLP) projectors. They direct light from the lamp to the Digital Micromirror Device (DMD) and then to the projection lens, enabling the high-quality image projection that DLP technology is known for.\nCamera Systems: In Single-Lens Reflex (SLR) cameras, pentaprisms play a critical role in the viewfinder system. They flip the image from the lens to appear upright and correctly oriented in the viewfinder, allowing photographers to accurately compose their shots.\nLaser Systems: Brewster prisms find use in laser systems for polarization and wavelength separation. Additionally, dispersing prisms can be employed for wavelength tuning in certain laser setups, providing precise control over the laser’s output characteristics.\nFiber Optic Communications: In the realm of telecommunications, prisms are utilized in some fiber optic connectors and switches. They help redirect light between fibers, playing a crucial role in maintaining signal integrity and enabling complex network architectures.\nSolar Energy: Fresnel lenses, a specialized type of prism, are employed in concentrated solar power systems. These lenses focus sunlight efficiently, contributing to the development of more effective solar energy collection technologies.\nHead-Up Displays (HUDs): Prisms are an integral part of HUD systems in both automotive and aviation contexts. They project crucial information onto the windshield or a combiner glass, allowing drivers or pilots to access important data without taking their eyes off their primary viewpoint.\nMicroscopy: Nomarski prisms enhance the capabilities of differential interference contrast microscopy. They increase contrast in transparent specimens, enabling scientists to observe details that would be difficult or impossible to see with conventional microscopy techniques.\nOptical Coherence Tomography (OCT): In some OCT systems, prisms are employed for sample arm scanning and reference arm delay. This application of prisms contributes to the high-resolution imaging capabilities of OCT, which is particularly valuable in medical diagnostics, especially in ophthalmology.",

    "text": "Lens Systems\nMost of the optical instruments consist of multiple lenses that are used to image objects or to magnify them. They are combined at distances, which are either larger or smaller than the sum of their focal distances. The image below shows for example an artifical image of a lens system contained in a single microscope objctive lens, where you see multiple elements e.g. doublets and triplets of lenses. These elements as joined objects may considerably improve the performance of the optics, e.g. correct for imaging errors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig.: System of of lenses inside a microscope objective lens.\n\n\n\nWe will consider first a pair of two bi-convex lenses that are at a distance \\(D&gt;f_1+f_2\\)m where \\(f_1\\) and \\(f_2\\) are their focal distances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig.: System of two bi-convex lenses at a distance larger than the sum of their focal distances.\n\n\n\nHere the first lens creates an image at a position\n\\[b_1=\\frac{a_1 f_1}{(a_1-f_1)}\\]\nAccordingly the object distance for lens 2 is then \\(a_2=D-b_1\\).\nThe second lens then images this intermediate object into\n\\[b_2=\\frac{a_2 f_2}{a_2-f_2}=\\frac{(D-b_1) f_2}{D-b_1-f_2}\\]\nfrom which we can finally calculate the image location and also size with the help of \\(b_1\\).\nInstead of doing a lengthy transformation I would like to draw your attention to a simple method which arises from the linearization of Snells law. This is called matrix optics. Matrix optics relates the outgoing angle \\(\\theta_2\\) and height \\(y_2\\) of an optical element to its incident angle \\(\\theta_1\\) and \\(y_1\\) via a matrix operation. Let’s have a look at an example of a bi-convex lens with a focal length \\(f\\). An incident ray is then expressed by a vector\n\\[\\begin{bmatrix}\ny_1\\\\\n\\theta_1\n\\end{bmatrix}\\]\nwhich is converted by the lens into an outgoing ray vector\n\\[\\begin{bmatrix}\ny_2\\\\\n\\theta_2\n\\end{bmatrix}\\]\nIf you have two 2D vectors which you want to transform by a linear operation into each other, then the transformation can be described by a 2x2 matrix, which is given for a lens with\n\\[\\begin{bmatrix}\nA & B\\\\\nC & D\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0\\\\\n-\\frac{1}{f} & 1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nSimilarly we can also define a free space propagation matrix for a propagation by a distance \\(D\\), which is\n\\[\\begin{bmatrix}\nA & B\\\\\nC & D\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & D\\\\\n0 & 1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThe propagation of light through two lenses, which are seprarated by a distance \\(D\\) is then the product of two matrices for the lenses and one for the free space. The transformation then in addition requires to multiply from the right side the incdent vector and we obtain on the left side the outgoing ray vector.\n\\[\\begin{bmatrix}\ny_2\\\\\n\\theta_2\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0\\\\\n-\\frac{1}{f_2} & 1 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & D\\\\\n0 & 1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0\\\\\n-\\frac{1}{f_1} & 1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\ny_1\\\\\n\\theta_1\n\\end{bmatrix}\\]\nIf you multiply the 2x2 matrices with each other, you will obtain a new 2x2 matrix with a matrix element \\(C\\), which should correspond to the effective focal length of that system. This is the case since the element \\(C=-\\frac{1}{f}\\)\nThe result of that calculation is\n\\[\\frac{1}{f}=\\frac{1}{f_1}+\\frac{1}{f_2}-\\frac{D}{f_1 f_2}\\]\nwhich gives the effective focal length of two bi-convex lenses at a distance \\(D\\).\nFollowing this equation the inverse of the total focal length of the combined lenses is just the sum of its inverse focal distances minus a term, which depends on the distance of the two lenses. If this distance is small as compared to the focal length, i.e. the lenses are close to each other, the total inverse focal is just given by the first two terms. The inverse focal distances characterize the refractive power of a lens. The larger the invserse value, the smaller is the focal distance. This refractive power is commonly measured in the unit diopter. One diopter corresponds to 1 dpt=1 \\(m^{-1}\\).\nThe image above shows also, that in the case of the combined lenses and a real inverted intermediate image, the final image will be upright again. Thus, if the first lens has a magnification \\(M_1=-b_1/a_1\\) and the second lens a magnification \\(M_2=-b_2/a_2\\) the total magnification is the product, which is\n\\[M=\\frac{b_1}{a_1}\\frac{b_2}{a_2}\\]\nfrom which we may finally obtain with \\(M=\\frac{f}{f-a}\\)\n\\[M=\\frac{1}{1-\\frac{a_1}{f_1}-\\frac{a_1+D}{f_2}+\\frac{a_1D}{f_1 f_2}}\\]\nFor more than two lenses, there is a versatile framework called Matrix Optics, which treats each optical element as a 2x2 matrix. This becomes possible as we derived earlier equations which were linear in \\(y\\) and \\(\\theta\\). A whole system of different lenses, plates and other optical elements can thus be treated as a matrix multiplication, which is quite useful."

    "text": "The simplest form of a microscope consists of an objective lens with a focal distance \\(f_1\\) and a magnifying glass called eye-piece with a focal length \\(f_2\\). In this system of two lenses (which are itself systems of lenses in modern microscopes, see below),\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig.: Cut through a microscope objective lens (left) and an eye-piece.\n\n\n\nthe object is placed at a distance \\(f_1&lt; a_1&lt;2f_1\\) from the objective lens creating a real and reversed image at a distance \\(b_1\\) behind the lens. This reversed image is observed by the eye through the eye-piece. The image of the objective lens is thereby adjusted to appear at the focal distance of the eye-piece.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig.: Sketch of a simple microscope. The strange object on the right is an eye.\n\n\n\nFor this simple microscope system we may calculate first the intermediate image position \\(b_1\\):\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{f_1}=\\frac{1}{a_1}+\\frac{1}{b_1}\n\\]\nresulting in\n\\[\nb_1=\\frac{a_1 f_1}{a_1-f_1}.\n\\]\nIf we assume a \\(\\delta\\) to be the distance of the object from the focal point of the objective lens, we even find for \\(\\delta \\rightarrow 0\\)\n\\[\nb_1=\\frac{a_1 f_1}{\\delta}.\n\\]\nThe intermediate image of size \\(B_1\\) is now imaged by a magnifying glass of focal distance \\(f_2\\). According to what we calculated earlier, we have now the observation angle\n\\[\n\\tan(\\epsilon)=\\frac{B_1}{f_2}=\\frac{Ab}{a_1 f_2}.\n\\]\nIf we observe the object of a size \\(A\\) and the clear visual distance \\(s_0\\), it would cover an angle of\n\\[\n\\tan(\\epsilon_0)=\\frac{A}{s_0}\n\\]\nand we may obtain the total angular magnification\n\\[\nV=\\frac{A b_1 s_0}{A b_1 f_2}=\\frac{b_1 s_0}{g f_2}.\n\\]\nIf we set the distance between the two lenses to \\(D=b_1+f_2\\) and \\(g\\approx f_1\\) then we obtain\n\\[\nV=\\frac{(D-f_2)s_0}{f_1 f_2}\n\\]\nwhich says that the magnification is the result of the two focal length \\(f_1,f_2\\).\n\nModern microscopy\nWhile the above description is correct for the simplest microscope you can think of, modern microscopes have much more complex light paths and work in general with optics, that is so-called inifinity corrected. Infinity corrected optics consists of an objective lens, which images the objects in the focal plane to infinity. Such an objctive lens always comes with a second lens, the tube lens, which together are designed to give a magnification specified at the objective lens housing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig.: Infinity optics vs. normal microscopy optics.\n\n\n\nInfinity optics allows you to have a free length with a parallel optical path where you can insert optical elements. There is no fixed tube length as in the case sketched above, where the distance of the intermediate image has to be considered. Therefore, it has tremendous technical advantages. Common optical microscopes are further today coupled to CCD cameras to record images digitally. Yet, an eye-piece may still be available in many cases. The sketch below shows the light path for a simple fluorescence microscope recording fluorescence images with a camera.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig.: Simple fluorescence microscope.\n\n\n\nThe possibility to digitally record images creates endless possibilities to computationally enhance and combine images. Nowadays the field of optics is one of the fastest developing fields in physics with numerous new techniques appearing every week. In this field of imaging methods of machine learning also play an increasingly important role. While I’m not ablields in physics with numerous new techniques appearing every week. In this field of imaging methods of machine learning also play an increasingly important role. While I am not able to refer to all possible optical microscopy techniques he to refer to all possible optical microscopy techniques here, I will exemplarily show some data from the Waller group at Berkley using computational methods to enhance the resolution by keeping at the same time a large field of view for imaging. This technique is called ptychography and can be understood if you consider Fourier Optics (a field of optics describing ligh propagation in terms Fourier transforms).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig.: Ptychographic imaging with LED arrays.\n\n\n\nThere is a massive amount of other techniques with increadible images being generated. Have a look around."
