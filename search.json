The simplest form of a microscope consists of an objective lens with a focal distance \\(f_1\\) and a magnifying glass called eye-piece with a focal length \\(f_2\\).

The image of the objective lens is thereby adjusted to appear at the focal distance of the eye-piece.\n\n\n\nFig.: Sketch of a simple microscope.

    "text": "Lens Systems\nMost of the optical instruments consist of multiple lenses that are used to image objects or to magnify them. They are combined at distances, which are either larger or smaller than the sum of their focal distances. The image below shows for example an artifical image of a lens system contained in a single microscope objctive lens, where you see multiple elements e.g. doublets and triplets of lenses. These elements as joined objects may considerably improve the performance of the optics, e.g. correct for imaging errors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig.: System of of lenses inside a microscope objective lens.\n\n\n\nWe will consider first a pair of two bi-convex lenses that are at a distance \\(D&gt;f_1+f_2\\)m where \\(f_1\\) and \\(f_2\\) are their focal distances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig.: System of two bi-convex lenses at a distance larger than the sum of their focal distances.\n\n\n\nHere the first lens creates an image at a position\n\\[b_1=\\frac{a_1 f_1}{(a_1-f_1)}\\]\nAccordingly the object distance for lens 2 is then \\(a_2=D-b_1\\).\nThe second lens then images this intermediate object into\n\\[b_2=\\frac{a_2 f_2}{a_2-f_2}=\\frac{(D-b_1) f_2}{D-b_1-f_2}\\]\nfrom which we can finally calculate the image location and also size with the help of \\(b_1\\).\nInstead of doing a lengthy transformation I would like to draw your attention to a simple method which arises from the linearization of Snells law. This is called matrix optics. Matrix optics relates the outgoing angle \\(\\theta_2\\) and height \\(y_2\\) of an optical element to its incident angle \\(\\theta_1\\) and \\(y_1\\) via a matrix operation. Let’s have a look at an example of a bi-convex lens with a focal length \\(f\\). An incident ray is then expressed by a vector\n\\[\\begin{bmatrix}\ny_1\\\\\n\\theta_1\n\\end{bmatrix}\\]\nwhich is converted by the lens into an outgoing ray vector\n\\[\\begin{bmatrix}\ny_2\\\\\n\\theta_2\n\\end{bmatrix}\\]\nIf you have two 2D vectors which you want to transform by a linear operation into each other, then the transformation can be described by a 2x2 matrix, which is given for a lens with\n\\[\\begin{bmatrix}\nA & B\\\\\nC & D\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0\\\\\n-\\frac{1}{f} & 1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nSimilarly we can also define a free space propagation matrix for a propagation by a distance \\(D\\), which is\n\\[\\begin{bmatrix}\nA & B\\\\\nC & D\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & D\\\\\n0 & 1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThe propagation of light through two lenses, which are seprarated by a distance \\(D\\) is then the product of two matrices for the lenses and one for the free space. The transformation then in addition requires to multiply from the right side the incdent vector and we obtain on the left side the outgoing ray vector.\n\\[\\begin{bmatrix}\ny_2\\\\\n\\theta_2\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0\\\\\n-\\frac{1}{f_2} & 1 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & D\\\\\n0 & 1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0\\\\\n-\\frac{1}{f_1} & 1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\ny_1\\\\\n\\theta_1\n\\end{bmatrix}\\]\nIf you multiply the 2x2 matrices with each other, you will obtain a new 2x2 matrix with a matrix element \\(C\\), which should correspond to the effective focal length of that system. This is the case since the element \\(C=-\\frac{1}{f}\\)\nThe result of that calculation is\n\\[\\frac{1}{f}=\\frac{1}{f_1}+\\frac{1}{f_2}-\\frac{D}{f_1 f_2}\\]\nwhich gives the effective focal length of two bi-convex lenses at a distance \\(D\\).\nFollowing this equation the inverse of the total focal length of the combined lenses is just the sum of its inverse focal distances minus a term, which depends on the distance of the two lenses. If this distance is small as compared to the focal length, i.e. the lenses are close to each other, the total inverse focal is just given by the first two terms. The inverse focal distances characterize the refractive power of a lens. The larger the invserse value, the smaller is the focal distance. This refractive power is commonly measured in the unit diopter. One diopter corresponds to 1 dpt=1 \\(m^{-1}\\).\nThe image above shows also, that in the case of the combined lenses and a real inverted intermediate image, the final image will be upright again. Thus, if the first lens has a magnification \\(M_1=-b_1/a_1\\) and the second lens a magnification \\(M_2=-b_2/a_2\\) the total magnification is the product, which is\n\\[M=\\frac{b_1}{a_1}\\frac{b_2}{a_2}\\]\nfrom which we may finally obtain with \\(M=\\frac{f}{f-a}\\)\n\\[M=\\frac{1}{1-\\frac{a_1}{f_1}-\\frac{a_1+D}{f_2}+\\frac{a_1D}{f_1 f_2}}\\]\nFor more than two lenses, there is a versatile framework called Matrix Optics, which treats each optical element as a 2x2 matrix. This becomes possible as we derived earlier equations which were linear in \\(y\\) and \\(\\theta\\). A whole system of different lenses, plates and other optical elements can thus be treated as a matrix multiplication, which is quite useful."

The ray is refracted and enters the droplet under an angle \\(\\beta\\) to the surface normal. The angle can be calculated from Snell’s law\n\\[n_{\\rm air}\\sin(\\alpha)=n_{\\rm water}\\sin(\\beta).\\]\nInside the droplet, the ray is now hitting the water/air surface at the backside from which it gets reflected. There, the incident angle is also \\(\\beta\\) and the ray is reflected under an angle \\(\\beta\\) as well. At that point, most of the light will, however, exit the drop on the backside, so that only a small fraction is reflected and traveling further to hit a second time the water/air surface at the angle \\(\\beta\\). The light refracted out at that point leaves the droplet under an angle \\(\\alpha\\) with the surface normal due to the reversiblity of the light path. We are, however, interested in the angle \\(\\phi\\) that the ray makes with the incident direction.\nThis angle \\(\\phi\\) can be calculated from the above sketch to be\n\\[\\phi=4\\beta-2\\alpha.\\]\nSince\n\\[\\beta=\\sin^{-1}\\left (\\frac{n_{\\rm air}}{n_{\\rm water}}\\sin(\\alpha) \\right)\\]\nsuch that finally\n\\[\\phi=4\\sin^{-1}\\left (\\frac{n_{\\rm air}}{n_{\\rm water}}\\sin(\\alpha) \\right)-2\\alpha\\]\nSo let us have a look at this dependence of the deflection angle as a function of the incidence angle.\n\n\nCode\nalpha=np.linspace(0,np.pi/2,10000)\nh2o=pd.read_csv(\"data/H2O.csv\",delimiter=\",\")\nn=np.interp(0.500,h2o.wl,h2o.n)\n\ndef rainbow(alpha,n):\n    return(4*np.arcsin(np.sin(alpha)/n)-2*alpha)\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(4,3))\nplt.plot(alpha*180/np.pi,rainbow(alpha,n)*180/np.pi)\nplt.xlabel(r\"incident angle $\\alpha$ [°]\")\nplt.ylabel(r\"deflection angle $\\phi$ [°]\")\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nDeflection angle of a light ray in a water droplet as a function of the incidence angle.

This is an important finding, as the whole appearance of the rainbow depends on that.\n\n\nMaximum deflection angle  41.78815648670841\n\n\n\nColor Formation and Dispersion\nThe color of the rainbow is the result of the fact that the maximum deflection angle depends on the color of the light due to the dispersion. Since we have a refraction, reflection and another refraction, the largest maximum deflection angle is observed for red light, while the smallest one appears for blue light. The diagrams below show this result, which is in general true for materials with normal dispersion.\n\n\nCode\nplt.figure(figsize=(8,4))\nplt.subplot(1,2,1)\nfor wl in np.linspace(0.400,0.700,100):\n    c=wavelength_to_rgb(wl*1000, gamma=0.8)\n    n=np.interp(wl,h2o.wl,h2o.n)\n    plt.plot(alpha*180/np.pi,rainbow(alpha,n)*180/np.pi,c=c,alpha=1,lw=1)\nplt.xlabel(r\"incident angle $\\alpha$ [°]\")\nplt.ylabel(r\"deflection angle $\\phi$ [°]\")\n\nplt.subplot(1,2,2)\nfor wl in np.linspace(0.400,0.700,100):\n    c=wavelength_to_rgb(wl*1000, gamma=0.8)\n    n=np.interp(wl,h2o.wl,h2o.n)\n    plt.plot(alpha*180/np.pi,rainbow(alpha,n)*180/np.pi,c=c,alpha=1,lw=1)\nplt.xlabel(r\"incident angle $\\alpha$ [°]\")\nplt.ylabel(r\"deflection angle $\\phi$ [°]\")\nplt.xlim(45,70)\nplt.ylim(40,43)\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nCaption\n\n\n\n\nThis order of the colors is actually true for all incident angles, which raises the question, why the rainbow is actually colored. The blue color of a certain incidence angle would actually overlap with the green color of a different incidence angle and the red color of an even different incidence angle. If you select a specific outgoing angle under which you observe the rainbow, let us say \\(41^{\\circ}\\), then you find under this observation angle all color and, therefore, should observe always white light.\nThis is actually true if you look at the inside of a rainbow. You clearly recognize that inside the rainbow it is much brighter than outside. Yet when you reach the maximum angle of each color, you have a region, where even for larger angles for the incidence angles, the deflection angle does not change. Thus, if you assume you send in rays at constantly spaced incidence angles, you will have more rays with a deflection angle close to the maximum. The diagram below just counts the number of deflection angles in the different for each color and you clearly see that around the maximum deflection angles for each color you have a strong peak.\n\n\nCode\nplt.figure(figsize=(6,4))\nfor wl in np.linspace(0.400,0.700,4):\n    c=wavelength_to_rgb(wl*1000, gamma=0.8)\n    n=np.interp(wl,h2o.wl,h2o.n)\n    plt.hist(rainbow(alpha,n)*180/np.pi,bins=400,color=c,alpha=0.6,lw=1);\nplt.xlabel(r\"deflection angle $\\alpha$ [°]\")\nplt.ylabel(r\"intensity [a.u.]\")\n\nplt.xlim(30,45)\nplt.ylim(0,150)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nHistogram of the deflection angle of light rays in a water droplet for different colors. The refractive index of water is taken from the data file H2O.csv.\n\n\n\n\nThus, around each droplet on the sky, there is a cone of deflected light reflected back from the sun. On the outside of that cone is red light under an angle of almost \\(42^{\\circ}\\) while on the inside edge we find blue light and finally white light (see left image below). We just have to connect that to the observer now. This is shown in the right sketch. The rainbow, therefore, results from the fact that we look at different height at different edges of the cone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Deflection cones\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Resulting rainbow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Deflection cones of different colors on a single drop in a rainbow (left) and the resulting rainbow as observed from these cones (right).\n\n\n\n\n\nPrimary and Secondary Rainbows\nThe photos below show a remarkable example of both primary and secondary rainbows. Between these two bows, a careful observer will notice a darker region known as Alexander’s dark band, first described by Alexander of Aphrodisias in 200 AD. This dark band occurs because no light is scattered back to the observer at angles between approximately \\(42^{\\circ}\\) (maximum angle of primary rainbow) and \\(50^{\\circ}\\) (minimum angle of secondary rainbow).\n\n\n\nDouble rainbow over Grand Canyon.

    "text": "Magnifying Glass\nA magnifying glass has several applications. First of all, it allows to see objects with details that would otherwise be too small to be observed with the eye even of the eye lens can accommodate to the distances. Such magnifying glasses are also used in microscopes as the so-called eye-piece as we will later see in the section on microscopes.\nConsider the sketch below. The sketch shows an object of a size \\(A\\) which is at a distance of \\(s_0\\) from the eye. The object makes an angle \\(\\epsilon_0\\) with the optical axis. If we insert now a lens into the space between object and eye and the lens is positioned in a way that it is exactly at a distance \\(f\\) (the focal distance of the lens) from the object then we are able to observe the object under a different angle \\(\\epsilon\\).\n\n\n\nMagnifying glass at the focal distance.\n\n\nThe magnification of this magnifying glass can the be calculated from the angles \\(\\epsilon\\approx A/f\\) and \\(\\epsilon_0\\approx A/s_0\\):\n\\[\nV=\\frac{\\tan(\\epsilon)}{\\tan(\\epsilon_0)}\\approx \\frac{\\epsilon}{\\epsilon_0}=\\frac{A}{f}\\frac{s_0}{A}=\\frac{s_0}{f}.\n\\]\nThe angular magnification is, thus, just given by the ratio of the clear visual range to the focal distance of the lens. If the focal distance \\(f\\) becomes much smaller than \\(s_0\\), large magnifications are possible.\nA second very useful effect is that when the object is placed inside the focal distance from the lens, the eye images a virtual image at infinite distance to the retina (see sketch). This means the eye muscle can stay relaxed when observing the object, while it would otherwise probably have to accommodate to the distance.\nYet, placing the object at exactly the focal distance is rather tedious when holding the magnifying glass by hand. If the object is now placed inside the focal distance of the magnifying glass, we may also calculate a magnification in this case knowing the virtual image size \\(B\\) created in this case (see sketch below)\n\n\n\nMagnifying glass for an object inside the focal range of the lens.\n\n\nIf \\(a\\) is the distance of the object from the principle plane of the magnifying glass and \\(b\\) and \\(B\\) are the distance and the size of the virtual image, respectively, we obtain\n\\[\nV=\\frac{\\tan(\\epsilon)}{\\tan(\\epsilon_0)}\\approx \\frac{\\epsilon}{\\epsilon_0}=\\frac{B}{b}\\frac{s_0}{A}=\\frac{s_0}{a}.\n\\]\nUsing the imaging equation\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{f}=\\frac{1}{a}+\\frac{1}{b}\n\\]\nwe may finally arrive at\n\\[\nV=\\frac{s_0(b-f)}{b\\,f}\n\\]\nin this case. If we place the virtual image directly at the clear visual range, i.e., \\(b=-s_0\\), we find\n\\[\nV=\\frac{s_0}{f}+1.\n\\]",

    "text": "When light radiates from a point \\(P\\) and reflects off a mirror, as shown in the image, the reflected rays diverge but appear to originate from a point \\(P'\\) located behind the mirror. According to the law of reflection, this image point is positioned at the same distance behind the mirror as the original object point is in front of it. As a result, an observer receiving these reflected rays, such as on their retina, perceives the point as if it were situated behind the mirror, even though no light actually travels behind the mirror surface.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Image formation on a plane mirror.\n\n\n\nWhen multiple points of an object emit light towards the mirror, this principle applies to each point. As a result, the entire object appears as an image behind the mirror. Since each point of the image is equidistant from the mirror as its corresponding object point, the image has the same size as the object. This leads to the definition of magnification as:\n\\[\nM=\\frac{h_{\\text{image}}}{h_{\\text{object}}}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Image formation on a plane mirror.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirtual Images\n\n\n\nA virtual image is an optical illusion where light rays appear to come from a point, but don’t actually converge there. Unlike real images, virtual images can’t be projected onto a screen. They’re commonly seen in plane mirrors, convex mirrors, and when objects are closer to a lens than its focal point. Remember: for virtual images, light rays only seem to originate from the image when traced backwards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReal Images\n\n\n\nA real image forms when light rays actually meet at a point after reflection or refraction. These images can be projected onto a screen because light physically passes through the image location. Real images are often inverted and occur with concave mirrors and lenses when objects are beyond the focal point. Key point: real images involve actual convergence of light rays.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a concave mirror (where the reflecting surface is on the inside of the spherical curve), applying the law of reflection yields interesting results. Light rays parallel to the optical axis, at a distance \\(h\\) from it, are reflected towards the axis and intersect it at a specific point \\(F\\). Due to the mirror’s symmetry, a parallel ray on the opposite side of the axis will also converge to this same point \\(F\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Reflection of a parallel ray incident at a height \\(h\\) from the optical axis on a concave mirror.\n\n\n\nWe may calculate the position of the point \\(F\\), e.g. the distance from the mirror surface point \\(O\\), by applying the law of reflection. If the spherical mirror surface has a radius \\(R\\), then the distance between the center of the sphere \\(M\\) and the point \\(F\\) is given by\n\\[FM=\\frac{R}{2\\cos(\\alpha)}\\]\nTherefore, we can also calculate the distance of the mirror surface from the point \\(F\\), which results in\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nOF=R\\left (1-\\frac{1}{2\\cos(\\alpha)}\\right)=f\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThis distance is the so-called focal length of the concave mirror \\(f\\). For small angle \\(\\alpha\\), the above equation yields the so called paraxial limit (all angles are small and the rays are close to the optical axis). In this limit we find \\(\\cos(\\alpha)\\approx 1\\) and the focal length becomes \\(f=R/2\\). If we replace the cosine function by \\(\\cos(\\alpha)=\\sqrt{1-\\sin^2(\\alpha)}\\) with \\(\\sin(\\alpha)=h/R\\), we find\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nf=R\\left [ 1-\\frac{R}{2\\sqrt{R^2-h^2}}\\right ]\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThis equation is telling us, that the focal distance is not a single value for a concave mirror. The focal distance rather changes with the distance \\(h\\) from the optical axis. If \\(h\\) approaches \\(R\\) the focal length become shorter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFocal Length of a Concave Spherical Mirror\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Set up the plot\nfig,(ax1,ax2)=plt.subplots(1,2,figsize=(7, 3))\n\n\nax1.axhline(y=0, color='k', linestyle='--', linewidth=0.5)\nax1.axvline(x=0, color='k', linestyle='--', linewidth=0.5)\n\n# Define the spherical mirror\nradius = 4\n\ntheta = np.linspace(-np.pi/3, np.pi/3, 100)\nx = radius * np.sin(theta)\ny = radius * (1 - np.cos(theta))\n\n# Plot the spherical mirror\nax1.plot(x, y, 'b-', linewidth=2, label='Spherical Mirror')\n\n# Calculate and plot the paraxial focal point\nparaxial_focal_length = radius / 2\nax1.plot([0], [paraxial_focal_length], 'ro', markersize=5, label='Paraxial Focal Point')\n\ndef reflect_ray(x0, y0):\n    xc, yc = 0, radius\n\n    # Normal vector\n    nx, ny = x0 - xc, y0 - yc\n    norm = np.sqrt(nx**2 + ny**2)\n    nx, ny = nx/norm, ny/norm\n\n    ix, iy = 0, -1\n\n    # Reflected ray direction\n    dot_product = 2 * (ix*nx + iy*ny)\n    rx, ry = ix - dot_product*nx, iy - dot_product*ny\n\n    return rx, ry\n\n# Plot several reflected rays\nnum_rays = 10\nfor x0 in np.linspace(-3, 3, num_rays):\n    y0 = radius - np.sqrt(radius**2 - x0**2)\n\n    # Incident ray\n    ax1.plot([x0, x0], [5, y0], 'k-', linewidth=1)\n\n    # Reflected ray\n    rx, ry = reflect_ray(x0, y0)\n    t = (0 - x0) / rx  # parameter to reach x=0\n    x1, y1 = x0 + t*rx, y0 + t*ry\n    ax1.plot([x0, x1], [y0, y1], 'k-', linewidth=1)\n\nax1.set_xlabel('h')\nax1.set_ylabel('y')\nax1.grid(True, linestyle=':', alpha=0.7)\nax1.axis('equal')\n\n\ndef focal_length(h, R):\n    return R * (1 - R / (2 * np.sqrt(R**2 - h**2)))\n\nR = 4  # Radius of curvature\nh = np.linspace(0, R*0.99, 1000)  # Range of h values (avoiding h=R which would cause division by zero)\n\nf = focal_length(h, R)\n\nax2.plot(h, f, 'b-', linewidth=2)\n\nax2.axhline(y=R/2, color='r', linestyle='--', label='Paraxial focal length (R/2)')\n\nax2.set_xlabel('h')\nax2.set_ylabel('f')\nax2.grid(True, linestyle=':', alpha=0.7)\n\nax2.set_ylim(0, R/2 * 1.1)\n\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Spherical mirror of radius \\(R=4\\) reflecting parallel rays, showing spherical aberration and focal distance as a function of the distance from the optical axis \\(h\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo obtain now an equation which predicts the point at which the reflected ray intersects the optical axis if it emerged at a point \\(A\\), we just consider the following sketch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Image formation on a concave mirror.\n\n\n\nFor this situation, we can write down immediately the following relations\n\\[\\delta=\\alpha+\\gamma\\]\n\\[\\gamma+\\beta=2\\delta\\]\nFurther under the assumption of small angles (paraxial approximation) we can write down\n\\[\\tan(\\gamma) \\approx \\gamma = \\frac{h}{g}\\] \\[\\tan(\\beta) \\approx \\beta = \\frac{h}{b}\\] \\[\\sin(\\delta) \\approx \\delta = \\frac{h}{R}\\]\nfrom which we obtain\n\\[\\frac{h}{g}+\\frac{h}{b}=2\\frac{h}{R}\\]\nand by divding by \\(h\\) finally the imaging equation:\n\\[\\frac{1}{g}+\\frac{1}{b}= \\frac{2}{R}= \\frac{1}{f}\\]\nwhere we have used the focal length \\(f=R/2\\). This equation has some surprising property. It is completely independent of \\(h\\) and \\(\\gamma\\). That means all points in a plane at a distance \\(g\\) are images into a plane at a distance \\(b\\). Both planes are therefore called conjugated planes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImaging Equation Concave Mirror\n\n\n\nThe sum of the inverse object and image distances equals the inverse focal length of the cocave mirror.\n\\[\\frac{1}{g}+\\frac{1}{b}\\approx\\frac{1}{f}\\]\n\n\nThis equation now helps to construct the image of an object in front of a concave mirror and we may define 3 different rays to identify the size of an image \\(h_{\\text{image}}\\) from the size of an object \\(h_{\\text{object}}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Image formation on a concave mirror.\n\n\n\nIn the diagram above, three key rays are used to construct the image:\n\nRed ray: Parallel to optical axis → reflects through focal point\nGreen ray: Through focal point → reflects parallel to optical axis\nCentral ray: Through center of curvature → reflects back along same path\n\nThe behavior of these reflected rays determines the nature of the image:\n\nIf the rays intersect on the same side of the mirror as the object, a real image forms. This image is inverted, as shown in the sketch.\nIf the rays diverge after reflection, they appear to intersect behind the mirror, creating a virtual image. This image is upright and located behind the mirror, though no actual ray intersection occurs.\n\nThe point where these rays meet (or appear to meet) determines the image size. By drawing a ray from the object’s tip through the mirror’s center (point O), we can easily determine the image height h_image. As an exercise, consider how this construction demonstrates that the magnification of a concave mirror is given by\n\\[ \\frac{h_{\\text{image}}}{h_{\\text{object}}}=-\\frac{b}{g}=M\\]\nThis ratio indeed represents the magnification \\(M\\). The negative sign in the expression reflects an important optical property: for real images formed by concave mirrors, the image is inverted relative to the object. This inversion is mathematically represented by the negative magnification value. Conversely, a positive magnification would indicate an upright image, which occurs with virtual images.\nWith the help of the imaging equation and the magnification we may in general differentiate between the following general situations:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObject Distance\nImage Characteristics\nImage Position\nMagnification\n\n\n\n\n\\(g &gt; 2f\\)\nReal, inverted, smaller\nBetween f and 2f\n\\(|m|\\) &lt; 1\n\n\n\\(g = 2f\\)\nReal, inverted, same size\nAt 2f\n\\(|m|\\) = 1\n\n\n\\(f &lt; g &lt; 2f\\)\nReal, inverted, larger\nBeyond 2f\n\\(|m|\\) &gt; 1\n\n\n\\(g = f\\)\nImage at infinity\nAt infinity\nN/A\n\n\n\\(g &lt; f\\)\nVirtual, upright, larger\nBehind mirror\n\\(|m|\\) &gt; 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParabolic Mirrors Focus Parallel Rays\n\n\n\n\n\nWe would like to show in the following, that a parabolic mirror is a shape which reflects all light rays parallel to the principal axis to a single point, the focus. This is a fundamental property of parabolic mirrors and is used in many optical systems, such as telescopes, satellite dishes, and car headlights.\nFor this purpose, we would like to use Fermat’s principle. We examine a light ray originating from a point \\(x,y_0\\) and travelling parallel to the principal axis. The light ray is reflected at a point \\((x,y)\\) on the mirror and travels to the focus at \\((0,p)\\). The light path is therefore consisting out of two linear segments \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) for which we have to calculate the time of travel. The total duration of the light’s journey is then: \\[\nt = t_A + t_B\n\\]\nwhere:\n\n\\(t_A\\) is the time taken to travel from \\(x,y_0\\) to the mirror.\n\\(t_B\\) is the time taken to travel from \\((x,y)\\) to \\((0,p)\\).\n\n\n\nThe distance covered in path A is equal to \\(y_0 - y\\), where \\(y\\) represents the y-coordinate of the point where the ray meets the mirror. Consequently, the time taken for the light to traverse path A can be expressed as:\n\\[\nt_A = \\frac{y_0 - y}{c}\n\\]\nIn this equation, \\(c\\) represents the speed of light in the medium.\n\n\n\nAfter reflection, the light ray travels from the point \\((x, y)\\) on the mirror’s surface to the focal point located at \\((0, p)\\). The length of this segment of the path can be calculated using the distance formula:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{x^2 + (y - p)^2}\n\\]\nConsequently, the time required for the light to traverse path B is expressed as:\n\\[\nt_B = \\frac{\\sqrt{x^2 + (y - p)^2}}{c}\n\\]\n\n\n\nThe total time for the light ray’s journey is the sum of times for paths A and B:\n\\[\nt = \\frac{y_0 - y}{v} + \\frac{\\sqrt{x^2 + (y - p)^2}}{c}\n\\]\nAccording to Fermat’s principle, all light rays should take the same time. We can express this by setting the total time equal to a constant \\(t_c\\):\n\\[\n\\frac{y_0 - y}{v} + \\frac{\\sqrt{x^2 + (y - p)^2}}{v} = t_c\n\\]\nFor a ray traveling along the y-axis, reflecting at \\((0, 0)\\), the total distance is \\(y_0 + p\\). The time for this ray is:\n\\[\n\\frac{y_0 + p}{c}\n\\]\nThis gives us \\(t_c = \\frac{y_0 + p}{c}\\). Substituting into our general equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{y_0 - y}{v} + \\frac{\\sqrt{x^2 + (y - p)^2}}{c} = \\frac{y_0 + p}{c}\n\\]\nMultiplying by \\(c\\) and rearranging:\n\\[\ny_0 - y + \\sqrt{x^2 + (y - p)^2} = y_0 + p\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sqrt{x^2 + (y - p)^2} = y + p\n\\]\nSquaring both sides and simplifying:\n\\[\nx^2 + (y - p)^2 = (y + p)^2\n\\]\n\\[\nx^2 + y^2 - 2py + p^2 = y^2 + 2py + p^2\n\\]\n\\[\nx^2 = 4py\n\\]\nor\n\\[\ny=\\frac{1}{4p}x^2\n\\]\nThis final equation describes a parabola with its focus at \\((0, p)\\).

This is because the sum of the distances from any point on the ellipse to the two focal points is constant. This property is known as the ellipse’s geometric definition and you can try that at home with a piece of string and two pins.\nWe can now apply Fermat’s principle to proof that the light reflected from the ellipse travels a path length that is a saddle point. This means that the path length is stationary with respect to small perturbations in the path. Assuming for example that light travels from one focal point by a different path that is reflected from a line which is tangent to the ellipse at the point of reflection, the path length would be longer at any other point than the initial reflection point.\nOn the other side, if we reflect the ray on a surface that is a circle, which is intersecting the ellipse at the point of reflection, the path length would be shorter at any other point than the initial reflection point. This is a proof that the ellipse is a saddle point.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider an ellipse with semi-major axis \\(a\\) and semi-minor axis \\(b\\), defined by:\n\\[\\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1\\]\n\n\nThe focal points are located at \\(F_1(-c, 0)\\) and \\(F_2(c, 0)\\), where:\n\\[c^2 = a^2 - b^2\\]\n\n\n\nLet \\(P(x_0, y_0)\\) be a point on the ellipse. The total path length \\(L\\) from \\(F_1\\) to \\(F_2\\) via \\(P\\) is:\n\\[L = |F_1P| + |PF_2| = \\sqrt{(x_0+c)^2 + y_0^2} + \\sqrt{(x_0-c)^2 + y_0^2}\\]\n\n\n\nThe path length \\(L\\) is stationary with respect to small perturbations in \\(P\\):\n\\[\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x_0} = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial y_0} = 0 \\quad \\text{at the reflection point}\\]\n\n\n\nThe tangent line to the ellipse at \\(P(x_0, y_0)\\) is given by:\n\\[\\frac{x_0x}{a^2} + \\frac{y_0y}{b^2} = 1\\]\nLet \\(Q\\) be any point on this tangent line different from \\(P\\). The path \\(F_1 \\to Q \\to F_2\\) is longer than \\(F_1 \\to P \\to F_2\\):\n\\[|F_1Q| + |QF_2| &gt; |F_1P| + |PF_2|\\]\n\n\n\nThe radius of curvature \\(R\\) at \\(P\\) is:\n\\[R = \\frac{(a^2b^2)^{3/2}}{(b^2x_0^2 + a^2y_0^2)^{3/2}}\\]\nThe center of curvature \\(C\\) is located at:\n\\[C = P + R\\cdot\\mathbf{n}\\]\nwhere \\(\\mathbf{n}\\) is the unit normal vector at \\(P\\).\nLet \\(Q\\) be any point on this circle different from \\(P\\).

    "text": "When light radiates from a point \\(P\\) and reflects off a mirror, as shown in the image, the reflected rays diverge but appear to originate from a point \\(P'\\) located behind the mirror. According to the law of reflection, this image point is positioned at the same distance behind the mirror as the original object point is in front of it. As a result, an observer receiving these reflected rays, such as on their retina, perceives the point as if it were situated behind the mirror, even though no light actually travels behind the mirror surface.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Image formation on a plane mirror.\n\n\n\nWhen multiple points of an object emit light towards the mirror, this principle applies to each point. As a result, the entire object appears as an image behind the mirror. Since each point of the image is equidistant from the mirror as its corresponding object point, the image has the same size as the object. This leads to the definition of magnification as:\n\\[\nM=\\frac{h_{\\text{image}}}{h_{\\text{object}}}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Image formation on a plane mirror.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirtual Images\n\n\n\nA virtual image is an optical illusion where light rays appear to come from a point, but don’t actually converge there. Unlike real images, virtual images can’t be projected onto a screen. They’re commonly seen in plane mirrors, convex mirrors, and when objects are closer to a lens than its focal point. Remember: for virtual images, light rays only seem to originate from the image when traced backwards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReal Images\n\n\n\nA real image forms when light rays actually meet at a point after reflection or refraction. These images can be projected onto a screen because light physically passes through the image location. Real images are often inverted and occur with concave mirrors and lenses when objects are beyond the focal point. Key point: real images involve actual convergence of light rays.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a concave mirror (where the reflecting surface is on the inside of the spherical curve), applying the law of reflection yields interesting results. Light rays parallel to the optical axis, at a distance \\(h\\) from it, are reflected towards the axis and intersect it at a specific point \\(F\\). Due to the mirror’s symmetry, a parallel ray on the opposite side of the axis will also converge to this same point \\(F\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Reflection of a parallel ray incident at a height \\(h\\) from the optical axis on a concave mirror.\n\n\n\nWe may calculate the position of the point \\(F\\), e.g. the distance from the mirror surface point \\(O\\), by applying the law of reflection. If the spherical mirror surface has a radius \\(R\\), then the distance between the center of the sphere \\(M\\) and the point \\(F\\) is given by\n\\[FM=\\frac{R}{2\\cos(\\alpha)}\\]\nTherefore, we can also calculate the distance of the mirror surface from the point \\(F\\), which results in\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nOF=R\\left (1-\\frac{1}{2\\cos(\\alpha)}\\right)=f\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThis distance is the so-called focal length of the concave mirror \\(f\\). For small angle \\(\\alpha\\), the above equation yields the so called paraxial limit (all angles are small and the rays are close to the optical axis). In this limit we find \\(\\cos(\\alpha)\\approx 1\\) and the focal length becomes \\(f=R/2\\). If we replace the cosine function by \\(\\cos(\\alpha)=\\sqrt{1-\\sin^2(\\alpha)}\\) with \\(\\sin(\\alpha)=h/R\\), we find\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nf=R\\left [ 1-\\frac{R}{2\\sqrt{R^2-h^2}}\\right ]\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThis equation is telling us, that the focal distance is not a single value for a concave mirror. The focal distance rather changes with the distance \\(h\\) from the optical axis. If \\(h\\) approaches \\(R\\) the focal length become shorter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFocal Length of a Concave Spherical Mirror\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Set up the plot\nfig,(ax1,ax2)=plt.subplots(1,2,figsize=(7, 3))\n\n\nax1.axhline(y=0, color='k', linestyle='--', linewidth=0.5)\nax1.axvline(x=0, color='k', linestyle='--', linewidth=0.5)\n\n# Define the spherical mirror\nradius = 4\n\ntheta = np.linspace(-np.pi/3, np.pi/3, 100)\nx = radius * np.sin(theta)\ny = radius * (1 - np.cos(theta))\n\n# Plot the spherical mirror\nax1.plot(x, y, 'b-', linewidth=2, label='Spherical Mirror')\n\n# Calculate and plot the paraxial focal point\nparaxial_focal_length = radius / 2\nax1.plot([0], [paraxial_focal_length], 'ro', markersize=5, label='Paraxial Focal Point')\n\ndef reflect_ray(x0, y0):\n    xc, yc = 0, radius\n\n    # Normal vector\n    nx, ny = x0 - xc, y0 - yc\n    norm = np.sqrt(nx**2 + ny**2)\n    nx, ny = nx/norm, ny/norm\n\n    ix, iy = 0, -1\n\n    # Reflected ray direction\n    dot_product = 2 * (ix*nx + iy*ny)\n    rx, ry = ix - dot_product*nx, iy - dot_product*ny\n\n    return rx, ry\n\n# Plot several reflected rays\nnum_rays = 10\nfor x0 in np.linspace(-3, 3, num_rays):\n    y0 = radius - np.sqrt(radius**2 - x0**2)\n\n    # Incident ray\n    ax1.plot([x0, x0], [5, y0], 'k-', linewidth=1)\n\n    # Reflected ray\n    rx, ry = reflect_ray(x0, y0)\n    t = (0 - x0) / rx  # parameter to reach x=0\n    x1, y1 = x0 + t*rx, y0 + t*ry\n    ax1.plot([x0, x1], [y0, y1], 'k-', linewidth=1)\n\nax1.set_xlabel('h')\nax1.set_ylabel('y')\nax1.grid(True, linestyle=':', alpha=0.7)\nax1.axis('equal')\n\n\ndef focal_length(h, R):\n    return R * (1 - R / (2 * np.sqrt(R**2 - h**2)))\n\nR = 4  # Radius of curvature\nh = np.linspace(0, R*0.99, 1000)  # Range of h values (avoiding h=R which would cause division by zero)\n\nf = focal_length(h, R)\n\nax2.plot(h, f, 'b-', linewidth=2)\n\nax2.axhline(y=R/2, color='r', linestyle='--', label='Paraxial focal length (R/2)')\n\nax2.set_xlabel('h')\nax2.set_ylabel('f')\nax2.grid(True, linestyle=':', alpha=0.7)\n\nax2.set_ylim(0, R/2 * 1.1)\n\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Spherical mirror of radius \\(R=4\\) reflecting parallel rays, showing spherical aberration and focal distance as a function of the distance from the optical axis \\(h\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo obtain now an equation which predicts the point at which the reflected ray intersects the optical axis if it emerged at a point \\(A\\), we just consider the following sketch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Image formation on a concave mirror.\n\n\n\nFor this situation, we can write down immediately the following relations\n\\[\\delta=\\alpha+\\gamma\\]\n\\[\\gamma+\\beta=2\\delta\\]\nFurther under the assumption of small angles (paraxial approximation) we can write down\n\\[\\tan(\\gamma) \\approx \\gamma = \\frac{h}{g}\\] \\[\\tan(\\beta) \\approx \\beta = \\frac{h}{b}\\] \\[\\sin(\\delta) \\approx \\delta = \\frac{h}{R}\\]\nfrom which we obtain\n\\[\\frac{h}{g}+\\frac{h}{b}=2\\frac{h}{R}\\]\nand by divding by \\(h\\) finally the imaging equation:\n\\[\\frac{1}{g}+\\frac{1}{b}= \\frac{2}{R}= \\frac{1}{f}\\]\nwhere we have used the focal length \\(f=R/2\\). This equation has some surprising property. It is completely independent of \\(h\\) and \\(\\gamma\\). That means all points in a plane at a distance \\(g\\) are images into a plane at a distance \\(b\\). Both planes are therefore called conjugated planes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImaging Equation Concave Mirror\n\n\n\nThe sum of the inverse object and image distances equals the inverse focal length of the cocave mirror.\n\\[\\frac{1}{g}+\\frac{1}{b}\\approx\\frac{1}{f}\\]\n\n\nThis equation now helps to construct the image of an object in front of a concave mirror and we may define 3 different rays to identify the size of an image \\(h_{\\text{image}}\\) from the size of an object \\(h_{\\text{object}}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Image formation on a concave mirror.\n\n\n\nIn the diagram above, three key rays are used to construct the image:\n\nRed ray: Parallel to optical axis → reflects through focal point\nGreen ray: Through focal point → reflects parallel to optical axis\nCentral ray: Through center of curvature → reflects back along same path\n\nThe behavior of these reflected rays determines the nature of the image:\n\nIf the rays intersect on the same side of the mirror as the object, a real image forms. This image is inverted, as shown in the sketch.\nIf the rays diverge after reflection, they appear to intersect behind the mirror, creating a virtual image. This image is upright and located behind the mirror, though no actual ray intersection occurs.\n\nThe point where these rays meet (or appear to meet) determines the image size. By drawing a ray from the object’s tip through the mirror’s center (point O), we can easily determine the image height h_image. As an exercise, consider how this construction demonstrates that the magnification of a concave mirror is given by\n\\[ \\frac{h_{\\text{image}}}{h_{\\text{object}}}=-\\frac{b}{g}=M\\]\nThis ratio indeed represents the magnification \\(M\\). The negative sign in the expression reflects an important optical property: for real images formed by concave mirrors, the image is inverted relative to the object. This inversion is mathematically represented by the negative magnification value. Conversely, a positive magnification would indicate an upright image, which occurs with virtual images.\nWith the help of the imaging equation and the magnification we may in general differentiate between the following general situations:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObject Distance\nImage Characteristics\nImage Position\nMagnification\n\n\n\n\n\\(g &gt; 2f\\)\nReal, inverted, smaller\nBetween f and 2f\n\\(|m|\\) &lt; 1\n\n\n\\(g = 2f\\)\nReal, inverted, same size\nAt 2f\n\\(|m|\\) = 1\n\n\n\\(f &lt; g &lt; 2f\\)\nReal, inverted, larger\nBeyond 2f\n\\(|m|\\) &gt; 1\n\n\n\\(g = f\\)\nImage at infinity\nAt infinity\nN/A\n\n\n\\(g &lt; f\\)\nVirtual, upright, larger\nBehind mirror\n\\(|m|\\) &gt; 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParabolic Mirrors Focus Parallel Rays\n\n\n\n\n\nWe would like to show in the following, that a parabolic mirror is a shape which reflects all light rays parallel to the principal axis to a single point, the focus. This is a fundamental property of parabolic mirrors and is used in many optical systems, such as telescopes, satellite dishes, and car headlights.\nFor this purpose, we would like to use Fermat’s principle. We examine a light ray originating from a point \\(x,y_0\\) and travelling parallel to the principal axis. The light ray is reflected at a point \\((x,y)\\) on the mirror and travels to the focus at \\((0,p)\\). The light path is therefore consisting out of two linear segments \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) for which we have to calculate the time of travel. The total duration of the light’s journey is then: \\[\nt = t_A + t_B\n\\]\nwhere:\n\n\\(t_A\\) is the time taken to travel from \\(x,y_0\\) to the mirror.\n\\(t_B\\) is the time taken to travel from \\((x,y)\\) to \\((0,p)\\).\n\n\n\nThe distance covered in path A is equal to \\(y_0 - y\\), where \\(y\\) represents the y-coordinate of the point where the ray meets the mirror. Consequently, the time taken for the light to traverse path A can be expressed as:\n\\[\nt_A = \\frac{y_0 - y}{c}\n\\]\nIn this equation, \\(c\\) represents the speed of light in the medium.\n\n\n\nAfter reflection, the light ray travels from the point \\((x, y)\\) on the mirror’s surface to the focal point located at \\((0, p)\\). The length of this segment of the path can be calculated using the distance formula:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{x^2 + (y - p)^2}\n\\]\nConsequently, the time required for the light to traverse path B is expressed as:\n\\[\nt_B = \\frac{\\sqrt{x^2 + (y - p)^2}}{c}\n\\]\n\n\n\nThe total time for the light ray’s journey is the sum of times for paths A and B:\n\\[\nt = \\frac{y_0 - y}{v} + \\frac{\\sqrt{x^2 + (y - p)^2}}{c}\n\\]\nAccording to Fermat’s principle, all light rays should take the same time. We can express this by setting the total time equal to a constant \\(t_c\\):\n\\[\n\\frac{y_0 - y}{v} + \\frac{\\sqrt{x^2 + (y - p)^2}}{v} = t_c\n\\]\nFor a ray traveling along the y-axis, reflecting at \\((0, 0)\\), the total distance is \\(y_0 + p\\). The time for this ray is:\n\\[\n\\frac{y_0 + p}{c}\n\\]\nThis gives us \\(t_c = \\frac{y_0 + p}{c}\\). Substituting into our general equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{y_0 - y}{v} + \\frac{\\sqrt{x^2 + (y - p)^2}}{c} = \\frac{y_0 + p}{c}\n\\]\nMultiplying by \\(c\\) and rearranging:\n\\[\ny_0 - y + \\sqrt{x^2 + (y - p)^2} = y_0 + p\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sqrt{x^2 + (y - p)^2} = y + p\n\\]\nSquaring both sides and simplifying:\n\\[\nx^2 + (y - p)^2 = (y + p)^2\n\\]\n\\[\nx^2 + y^2 - 2py + p^2 = y^2 + 2py + p^2\n\\]\n\\[\nx^2 = 4py\n\\]\nor\n\\[\ny=\\frac{1}{4p}x^2\n\\]\nThis final equation describes a parabola with its focus at \\((0, p)\\).

    "text": "Historical Context of Reflection Laws\n\n\n\n\n\nThe study of reflection has a rich history dating back to ancient times:\n\nAncient Greece (300 BCE): Euclid, in his work “Catoptrics,” was among the first to formally describe the law of reflection. He stated that the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection.\nAncient Rome (50 CE): Hero of Alexandria expanded on Euclid’s work, applying the principle that light travels along the path of least distance.\nIslamic Golden Age (1000 CE): Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) made significant contributions to optics in his “Book of Optics.” He conducted experiments to verify the law of reflection and explored the properties of spherical and parabolic mirrors.\n17th Century: Fermat’s Principle, formulated by Pierre de Fermat, provided a more general framework for understanding reflection (and refraction) based on the principle of least time.\nModern Era: The understanding of reflection has been further refined with the development of electromagnetic theory by James Clerk Maxwell in the 19th century and quantum optics in the 20th century.\n\n\n\n\nThe law of reflection is probably the most simple one. Yet the simplicity gives us the chance to define some basic objects which we will further use for the description of light rays and their propagation.\n\nLaw of Reflection\nThe sketch below shows the reflection of an incoming light ray (red) on an interface. This incoming light ray has an angle \\(\\theta_{1}\\) with the axis (dashed line), which is perpendicular to the reflecting surface. As compared to X-ray diffraction, we measure the angle to the normal of the surface and not to the surface itself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Law of reflection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Experimental Demonstration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1— Figure 1 (a) illustrates the law of reflection, while Figure Figure 1 (b) shows an experimental demonstration.\n\n\n\nFigure 1 (a) shows the reflection of an incoming light ray (red) on an interface. This incoming light ray has an angle \\(\\theta_{1}\\) with the axis (dashed line), which is perpendicular to the reflecting surface. As compared to X-ray diffraction, we measure the angle to the normal of the surface and not to the surface itself.\nThe law of reflection tells us now, that the outgoing reflected ray is now leaving the surface under an angle \\(\\theta_2=\\theta_1\\). So both angles are the same for the reflection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaw of Reflection\n\n\n\nIf a ray is incident to a reflecting surface under an angle \\(\\theta_1\\) it will be reflected towards under an angle \\(\\theta_2=\\theta_1\\) to the same side of the surface.\n\n\n\n\nFermat’s Principle\nThe law of reflection can be actually obtained from a variational principle saying the light rays propagate along those path on which the propagation time is an extremum. This variational principle is called Fermat’s principle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2— Sketch for deriving the law of reflection from Fermat’s principle\n\n\n\nConsider now a light ray that should travel from point \\(A\\) to point \\(C\\) via a point \\(B\\) on the mirror surface. In general multiple paths are possible such as the one indicated in the above picture. Clearly this path is not satisfying our reflection law formulated above. Fermat’s principle now restricts the path length from \\(A\\) to \\(C\\) to be the one, which takes the least amount of time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFermat’s principle\n\n\n\nThe path taken by a ray between two given points A, B is the path that can be traversed in the least time.\nMore precise alternative: A ray going in a certain particular path has the property that if we make a small change in the ray in any manner whatever, say in the location at which it comes to the mirror, or the shape of the curve, or anything, there will be no first-order change in the time; there will be only a second-order change in the time.\n\n\nSo let us consider that contraints to the path length. The total length the light hast to travel via the three points is\n\\[\nl=l_{1}+l_{2}=\\sqrt{(x-x_1)^2+y_1^2}+\\sqrt{(x_2-x)^2+y_2^2}\n\\]\nThe time that is required by the light to travel that distance \\(l\\) is then given by\n\\[\nt=\\frac{l}{c},\n\\]\nwhere \\(c\\) is the speed of light in the medium above the mirror. If this time should now be a minimum, we have to take the derivative of the time \\(t\\) with respect to the position \\(x\\) on the mirror and set that to zero, i.e.,\n\\[\\frac{\\mathrm dt}{\\mathrm dx}=0. \\tag{1}\\]\nThis results in Eq. 1\n\\[\n\\frac{x-x_1}{\\sqrt{(x-x_1)^2+y_{1}^2}}=\\frac{x_2-x}{\\sqrt{(x_2-x)^2+y_{2}^2}},\n\\]\nwhich is actually\n\\[\n\\frac{x-x_1}{l_1}=\\frac{x_2-x}{l_2}\n\\]\nor\n\\[\n\\sin(\\theta_1)=\\sin(\\theta_2)\n\\]\nwhich finally requires\n\\[\n\\theta_1=\\theta_2\n\\]\nand is our law of reflection. Thus, reflection satisfies Fermat’s principle, i.e. the light rays propagate along those path on which the propagation time is an extremum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrinciple of Least Action (Hamilton’s Principle)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Principle of Least Action, also known as Hamilton’s Principle, is a fundamental concept in classical mechanics. It states that the path taken by a physical system between two states is the one for which the action integral is stationary (usually a minimum).\n\nAction Integral\nThe action \\(S\\) is defined as the integral of the Lagrangian \\(L\\) over time:\n\\[\nS = \\int_{t_1}^{t_2} L \\, dt\n\\]\n\n\nLagrangian\nThe Lagrangian \\(L\\) is a function that summarizes the dynamics of the system. For a system with generalized coordinates \\(q_i\\) and velocities \\(\\dot{q}_i\\), the Lagrangian is typically given by:\n\\[\nL = T - V\n\\]\nwhere:\n\n\\(T\\) is the kinetic energy of the system.\n\\(V\\) is the potential energy of the system.\n\n\n\nEuler-Lagrange Equations\nHamilton’s Principle leads to the Euler-Lagrange equations, which are the equations of motion for the system. These equations are derived by requiring that the action \\(S\\) be stationary with respect to variations in the path \\(q_i(t)\\):\n\\[\n\\delta S = 0\n\\]\nThis condition leads to the following differential equations:\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\left( \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{q}_i} \\right) - \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial q_i} = 0\n\\]\nThese are the Euler-Lagrange equations, and they provide a powerful method for deriving the equations of motion for a wide variety of physical systems.\n\n\nExample: Simple Harmonic Oscillator\nFor a simple harmonic oscillator with mass \\(m\\) and spring constant \\(k\\), the Lagrangian is:\n\\[\nL = \\frac{1}{2} m \\dot{x}^2 - \\frac{1}{2} k x^2\n\\]\nApplying the Euler-Lagrange equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\left( \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{x}} \\right) - \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x} = 0\n\\]\nwe get:\n\\[\nm \\ddot{x} + k x = 0\n\\]\nwhich is the familiar equation of motion for a simple harmonic oscillator.\nHamilton’s Principle and the associated Euler-Lagrange equations are foundational in classical mechanics and have far-reaching implications in other areas of physics, including quantum mechanics and field theory.",

    "text": "Historical Context of Refraction\n\n\n\n\n\nThe understanding of refraction has evolved over centuries, with contributions from various cultures and scientific traditions. This timeline highlights key milestones in the discovery and formalization of refraction, showcasing how our comprehension of this fundamental optical phenomenon has deepened over time:\n\nAncient Greece (3rd century BCE): Euclid noticed that a stick partially submerged in water appears bent. Archimedes studied the refraction of light in water.\nAncient Rome (1st century CE): Ptolemy conducted experiments on refraction and compiled tables of refraction angles for different media.\nIslamic Golden Age (10th-11th centuries): Ibn Sahl (940-1000) discovered the law of refraction, describing it geometrically. Alhazen (965-1040) studied lenses and the human eye, contributing significantly to optics.\nMiddle Ages: Robert Grosseteste (1175-1253) and Roger Bacon (1214-1294) studied refraction and its application to lenses.\nRenaissance: Thomas Harriot (1560-1621) rediscovered the law of refraction but didn’t publish his findings.\n17th Century: Willebrord Snellius (1580-1626) derived the mathematical law of refraction (Snell’s law) around 1621. René Descartes (1596-1650) independently derived and published the law of refraction in 1637. Pierre de Fermat (1607-1665) derived the law of refraction using his principle of least time.\n19th Century: Augustin-Jean Fresnel (1788-1827) developed the wave theory of light, explaining refraction in terms of changes in wave speed.\n20th Century: The quantum mechanical understanding of light, which emerged in the early 20th century, significantly impacted our view of refraction. Max Planck’s work on black body radiation in 1900 and Albert Einstein’s explanation of the photoelectric effect in 1905 laid the groundwork for the quantum nature of light. This quantum perspective provided a complementary explanation to the wave theory, describing refraction in terms of photons interacting with the atoms in the medium. While this quantum view offers insights into certain aspects of refraction, it’s important to note that both the wave and particle descriptions of light are necessary for a complete understanding of optical phenomena.\n\n\n\n\nThe law of refraction is the second important law of geometrical optics. It relates the refractive index \\(n_1\\) and angle of incidence \\(\\theta_1\\) on one side of an interface to the refractive index \\(n_2\\) and angle of refraction \\(\\theta_2\\) on the other side. Both the law of reflection and the law of refraction can be derived from more fundamental principles such as Fermat’s principle of least time and are consistent with the conservation of energy. Their relation to momentum is more complex and involves considering the interaction of light with the medium at an atomic level. These laws provide a mathematical framework for predicting how light behaves when it encounters interfaces between different media, forming the basis for understanding a wide range of optical phenomena and the design of optical devices.\n\n\nThe refractive index \\(n\\) is a material constant representing the factor by which the speed of light is reduced in the medium compared to its speed in vacuum. For most natural materials and visible light, the refractive index is \\(n \\ge 1\\), as light typically travels slower in media than in vacuum. However, in certain special cases—such as for X-rays in some materials or in engineered metamaterials—the refractive index can be less than 1 or even negative. Understanding these exotic cases requires a deeper exploration of the electromagnetic properties of materials and the origin of the refractive index, which we will address later.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaw of Refraction (Snell’s Law)\n\n\n\nThe law of refraction (Snell’s law) is given for the above sketch by the equation:\n\\[\nn_1 \\sin(\\theta_1)=n_2 \\sin(\\theta_2)\n\\]\n\n\nYou can explore the law of refraction using the interactive visualization below. The visualization shows a light ray incident on an interface between two media with different refractive indices. You can adjust the angle of incidence and the refractive index of the first medium to see how the angle of refraction changes according to Snell’s law.\n\n\n\nIncident Angle: 45°\n\nRefractive Index n₁: 1.0\n\nRefractive Index n₂: 1.5\n\n\n\n\nSnell’s law leads to some general patterns in the behavior of light rays at interfaces, which are worth remembering. Consider these two cases:\n\nWhen light moves from a medium with lower refractive index to one with higher refractive index (\\(n_1 &lt; n_2\\)):\n\nThe refracted ray bends towards the normal (optical axis)\nThe angle of refraction is smaller than the angle of incidence (\\(\\theta_2 &lt; \\theta_1\\))\n\nWhen light moves from a medium with higher refractive index to one with lower refractive index (\\(n_1 &gt; n_2\\)):\n\nThe refracted ray bends away from the normal (optical axis)\nThe angle of refraction is larger than the angle of incidence (\\(\\theta_2 &gt; \\theta_1\\))\n\n\nFigure 1 illustrates these principles with three plots showing how the refracted angle changes with the incident angle for two common interface scenarios: glass-to-air and air-to-glass. These plots clearly demonstrate the different behaviors described above.\n\n\n\nCode\ndef snell(n1, n2, theta1):\n    sin_theta2 = n1 * np.sin(theta1) / n2\n    theta2 = np.arcsin(np.clip(sin_theta2, -1, 1))\n    theta2[sin_theta2 &gt; 1] = np.nan\n    return theta2\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(4, 4))\n\ntheta1 = np.linspace(0, np.pi/2, 1000)\n\ntheta2_1_to_1_5 = snell(1.0, 1.5, theta1)\ntheta2_1_5_to_1 = snell(1.5, 1.0, theta1)\ntheta2_1_to_1 = snell(1.0, 1.0, theta1)\n\nax.plot(np.degrees(theta1), np.degrees(theta2_1_to_1_5), color='blue')\nax.plot(np.degrees(theta1), np.degrees(theta2_1_5_to_1), color='red')\nax.plot(np.degrees(theta1), np.degrees(theta2_1_to_1), color='green', linestyle='--')\n\nax.set_xlabel(r'$\\theta_1$ [°]')\nax.set_ylabel(r'$\\theta_2$ [°]')\nax.set_xlim(0, 90)\nax.set_ylim(0, 90)\n\nax.plot([0, 90], [0, 90], color='gray', linestyle=':', label='y=x')\n\nax.annotate(r'$\\frac{n_2}{n_1}=1.5$', xy=(60, 35), xytext=(50, 20),\n            arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle='-&gt;'), color='blue')\nax.annotate(r'$\\frac{n_1}{n_2}=1.5$', xy=(30, 50), xytext=(10, 70),\n            arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle='-&gt;'), color='red')\nax.annotate(r'$\\frac{n_2}{n_1}=1$', xy=(45, 45), xytext=(65, 50),\n            arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle='-&gt;'), color='green')\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1— Snell’s law for different combinations of refractive indices. The plots show the relationship between incident angle (\\(\\theta_1\\)) and refracted angle (\\(\\theta_2\\)) for three scenarios: (a) light passing from air to glass, (b) light passing from glass to air, and (c) a comparison of both cases. Note how the curves differ when light moves into a medium with higher refractive index versus a lower refractive index.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above diagram reveals a special case occurring when \\(n_1 &gt; n_2\\). Under these conditions, we can increase the incident angle \\(\\theta_1\\) until the outgoing angle reaches \\(\\theta_2 = \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\). At this point, the refracted ray would be traveling along the interface between the two media. For any incident angle \\(\\theta_1\\) larger than this critical angle, there is no refracted ray at all; instead, we observe only a reflected ray. This phenomenon, known as total internal reflection, occurs despite the fact that the material with refractive index \\(n_2\\) is completely transparent.\nLet’s formalize this concept mathematically. Using Snell’s law and setting \\(\\theta_2 = \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\), we obtain the equation for the critical angle \\(\\theta_c\\):\n\\[\\theta_1 = \\theta_c = \\sin^{-1}\\left(\\frac{n_2}{n_1}\\right)\\]\nNote that the \\(\\sin^{-1}()\\) function requires an argument \\(\\le 1\\), which is why this phenomenon only occurs when \\(n_2 &lt; n_1\\).\nIt’s important to understand that during total internal reflection, all of the light energy is reflected back into the first medium, hence the term ‘total’. However, electromagnetic optics reveals an interesting subtlety: an evanescent wave penetrates a short distance into the second medium, though it doesn’t propagate energy across the boundary.\nWhen the incident angle exceeds the critical angle, Snell’s law as we’ve written it no longer applies. Instead, we observe perfect reflection, where the angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence, just as in regular reflection from a mirror. This reflection occurs without any loss of energy to the second medium, making it an extremely efficient process.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Internal Reflection\n\n\n\nTotal internal reflection occurs when light is passing from higher refractive index to lower refractive index materials for incidence angle larger than a critical angle\n\\[\n\\theta_c=\\sin^{-1}\\left (\\frac{n_2}{n_1}\\right )\n\\]\n\n\nWe can demonstrate total internal reflection very easily with a water basin, for example, where we couple in light from a laser from the side.\n \nBut you could try that yourself also in the bath tub diving below the water surface.\nTotal internal reflection has numerous practical applications:\n\nFiber optic communications: Light signals can travel long distances with minimal loss through optical fibers.\nOptical instruments: Prisms in binoculars and telescopes use total internal reflection to manipulate light paths.\nGemstones: The sparkle of diamonds is enhanced by total internal reflection trapping light within the stone.\nMedical endoscopes: Total internal reflection helps guide light through flexible tubes for internal imaging.\n\nOptical Fibers and Total Internal Reflection\nTotal internal reflection plays a crucial role in modern telecommunications, particularly in optical fibers, which are also part of many experimental setups. These fibers are essentially ultra-thin glass wires, ranging in diameter from a few micrometers to several hundred micrometers, designed to transport light over long distances with minimal loss.\nThe structure of an optical fiber is key to its function:\n\nCore: A central glass core with a refractive index \\(n_1\\)\nCladding: A surrounding layer with a slightly lower refractive index \\(n_2\\)\n\nThis difference in refractive indices is what allows total internal reflection to occur within the fiber.\n \nFor light to propagate effectively through the fiber, it must enter at an angle that ensures total internal reflection at the core-cladding interface. This leads to the concept of the acceptance angle, \\(\\theta_a\\), which is the maximum angle at which light can enter the fiber and still undergo total internal reflection.\nTo characterize this acceptance angle, optical engineers use a parameter called the Numerical Aperture (NA).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumerical Aperture\n\n\n\nThe Numerical Aperture of a fiber is defined as the sine of the maximum acceptance angle:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nNA = \\sin(\\theta_a) = \\sqrt{n_1^2 - n_2^2}\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\n\nThis equation relates the NA directly to the refractive indices of the core and cladding. The derivation of this formula involves applying Snell’s law at the air-fiber interface and at the core-cladding interface, then using the condition for total internal reflection.\nIn practice, typical values for the refractive indices might be \\(n_1 = 1.475\\) for the core and \\(n_2 = 1.46\\) for the cladding. Plugging these into our equation:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nNA = \\sqrt{1.475^2 - 1.46^2} \\approx 0.2\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThis means that light entering the fiber within a cone of about 11.5° (arcsin(0.2)) from the fiber’s axis will be transmitted through the fiber via total internal reflection.\nThe NA is an important parameter in fiber optic design:\n\nIt determines the light-gathering ability of the fiber.\nIt affects the fiber’s bandwidth and its susceptibility to certain types of signal distortion.\nIt influences how easily the fiber can be coupled to light sources and other fibers.\n\nOptical fibers come in various types, each optimized for different applications. Some fibers are designed to transmit light over long distances with minimal loss, while others are engineered for specific wavelengths or to guide light in unusual ways. The figure below shows a few examples of optical fiber types.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2— Rendering of different optical fibers types (from left to right): Hollow core optical fiber, hollow core bragg fiber, photonic crystal fiber, conventional fiber\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile before we have considered Fermat’s principle for the special case of refraction and light propagation in a homogeneous medium, we can define a more general version of it correponding to the following situation also involving an inhomogeneous refractive index \\(n(\\vec{r})\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3— Sketch for a general description of Fermat’s principle\n\n\n\nFor this general scenario of light traveling along a path, we can define an optical path length (OPL) as\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\text{OPL} = \\int\\limits_{A}^{C} n(\\mathbf{r}) \\mathrm ds=0,\n\\end{equation}\\]\nwith a varying refractive index \\(n(\\mathbf{r})\\). Fermat’s Principle states that the actual path taken by the light makes the OPL stationary:\n\\[\n\\delta \\left( \\int_A^B n(\\mathbf{r}) \\, ds \\right) = 0\n\\]\nUsing the calculus of variations, this leads to the Euler-Lagrange equation for the path of light. In Cartesian coordinates, if the path is parameterized by \\(\\mathbf{r}(s) = (x(s), y(s), z(s))\\), the Euler-Lagrange equations become:\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{ds} \\left( n \\frac{d\\mathbf{r}}{ds} \\right) = \\nabla n\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\nabla n\\) is the gradient of the refractive index. This equation describes how the light ray bends in response to changes in the refractive index of the medium.\nFermat’s Principle is a cornerstone of geometrical optics and has applications in designing optical systems, understanding mirages, and analyzing the behavior of light in various media.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFermat’s Principle and Snells Law\n\n\n\n\n\nWe would like to apply Fermat’s principle to derive Snell’s law, which is a more lengthy calculation. To do this, we consider a light ray traveling from point \\(A\\) in medium 1 (with refractive index \\(n_1\\)) to point \\(C\\) in medium 2 (with refractive index \\(n_2\\)), crossing the interface at point \\(B\\). Let the coordinates of points \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) be \\((x_A, y_A)\\), \\((x_B, y_B)\\), and \\((x_C, y_C)\\), respectively. Assume the interface between the two media is at \\(y = y_B\\). The optical path length (OPL) is given by:\n\\[\n\\delta \\int_{A}^{C} n(\\vec{r}) \\, ds = 0,\n\\]\nwhere \\(n(\\vec{r})\\) is the refractive index at position \\(\\vec{r}\\), and \\(ds\\) is an infinitesimal element of the path.\nConsider a light ray traveling from point \\(A\\) in medium 1 (with refractive index \\(n_1\\)) to point \\(C\\) in medium 2 (with refractive index \\(n_2\\)), crossing the interface at point \\(B\\). Let the coordinates of points \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) be \\((x_A, y_A)\\), \\((x_B, y_B)\\), and \\((x_C, y_C)\\), respectively. Assume the interface between the two media is at \\(y = y_B\\).\n\n\nThe optical path length (OPL) is given by:\n\\[\n\\text{OPL} = n_1 \\int_{A}^{B} ds_1 + n_2 \\int_{B}^{C} ds_2,\n\\]\nwhere \\(ds_1\\) and \\(ds_2\\) are the infinitesimal path lengths in media 1 and 2, respectively.\n\n\n\nThe path lengths \\(ds_1\\) and \\(ds_2\\) can be expressed in terms of the coordinates:\n\\[\nds_1 = \\sqrt{(dx_1)^2 + (dy_1)^2}, \\quad ds_2 = \\sqrt{(dx_2)^2 + (dy_2)^2}.\n\\]\nSince the interface is at \\(y = y_B\\), we have \\(dy_1 = y_B - y_A\\) and \\(dy_2 = y_C - y_B\\). The total optical path length is:\n\\[\n\\text{OPL} = n_1 \\sqrt{(x_B - x_A)^2 + (y_B - y_A)^2} + n_2 \\sqrt{(x_C - x_B)^2 + (y_C - y_B)^2}.\n\\]\n\n\n\nTo find the stationary path, we take the variation of the OPL with respect to \\(x_B\\):\n\\[\n\\delta \\text{OPL} = \\delta \\left[ n_1 \\sqrt{(x_B - x_A)^2 + (y_B - y_A)^2} + n_2 \\sqrt{(x_C - x_B)^2 + (y_C - y_B)^2} \\right] = 0.\n\\]\nTaking the derivative with respect to \\(x_B\\):\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_B} \\left[ n_1 \\sqrt{(x_B - x_A)^2 + (y_B - y_A)^2} + n_2 \\sqrt{(x_C - x_B)^2 + (y_C - y_B)^2} \\right] = 0.\n\\]\n\n\n\nDifferentiating each term separately:\n\\[\nn_1 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_B} \\sqrt{(x_B - x_A)^2 + (y_B - y_A)^2} + n_2 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_B} \\sqrt{(x_C - x_B)^2 + (y_C - y_B)^2} = 0.\n\\]\nUsing the chain rule:\n\\[\nn_1 \\frac{x_B - x_A}{\\sqrt{(x_B - x_A)^2 + (y_B - y_A)^2}} + n_2 \\frac{x_B - x_C}{\\sqrt{(x_C - x_B)^2 + (y_C - y_B)^2}} = 0.\n\\]\n\n\n\nLet \\(\\theta_1\\) be the angle of incidence and \\(\\theta_2\\) be the angle of refraction. Then:\n\\[\n\\sin \\theta_1 = \\frac{x_B - x_A}{\\sqrt{(x_B - x_A)^2 + (y_B - y_A)^2}}, \\quad \\sin \\theta_2 = \\frac{x_C - x_B}{\\sqrt{(x_C - x_B)^2 + (y_C - y_B)^2}}.\n\\]\nSubstituting these into the equation:\n\\[\nn_1 \\sin \\theta_1 + n_2 \\sin \\theta_2 = 0.\n\\]\nSince \\(\\sin \\theta_2\\) is in the opposite direction, we have:\n\\[\nn_1 \\sin \\theta_1 = n_2 \\sin \\theta_2.\n\\]\nThis is Snell’s law, which describes the relationship between the angles of incidence and refraction when light passes from one medium to another.\n\n\n\nBy applying Fermat’s principle and taking the variation of the optical path length, we have derived Snell’s law:\n\\[\nn_1 \\sin \\theta_1 = n_2 \\sin \\theta_2.\n\\]\nThis demonstrates how the principle of least time leads to the well-known law of refraction in optics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Light in a Graded-Index Medium\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider a medium where the refractive index varies with height \\(y\\) as \\(n(y) = n_0 (1 - \\frac{\\alpha^2}{2 n_0} y^2)\\). The path of light in such a medium can be found by using Fermat’s principle in differential form:\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{ds}\\left (n(\\textbf{r})\\frac{d\\textbf{r}}{ds}\\right)=\\nabla n(\\textbf{r})\n\\]\nTypically, this requires to express the coordinates in terms of a parameter, such as \\(x(s)\\) and \\(y(s)\\), and then solve the differential equation. The solution will give the path of light in the medium. This is difficult and commonly done numerically. In paraxial optics, when the light is propagating roughly in the direction of \\(z\\), the differential element \\(ds\\) can be approximated as \\(dz\\) since then\n\\[\nds=dz\\sqrt{1+\\left (\\frac{dy}{dz}\\right )^2+\\left (\\frac{dx}{dz}\\right)^2}\\approx dz\n\\]\nwhich yields\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{dz}\\left (n\\frac{dx}{dz}\\right)\\approx \\frac{dn}{dx}\n\\]\nand\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{dz}\\left (n\\frac{dy}{dz}\\right )\\approx \\frac{dn}{dy}\n\\]\nThis readily yields the path of light in a homogeneous medium, where \\(n\\) is constant. In this case we have\n\\[\n\\frac{d^2 x}{dz^2}=\\frac{d^2 y}{dz^2}=0\n\\]\nwhich is true for a straight line. In a graded-index medium, the path of light can be found by solving the differential equation\n\\[\n\\frac{d^2 y}{dz^2}=-\\alpha^2 y\n\\]\nwhich is reminiscent of the equation of motion of a harmonic oscillator. The solution is therefore an oscillating function\n\\[\ny(z)=y_0\\cos(\\alpha z)+\\frac{\\theta_0}{\\alpha}\\sin(\\alpha z  )\n\\]\nwhere the angle \\(\\theta_0\\) is the initial angle of the light ray with respect to the \\(z\\) axis. This solution describes the path of light in a graded-index medium.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFermats’s Principle in Integral and Differential Form\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have described Fermat’t principle in an integral form specifiying the optical path length \\(S\\) as\n\\[\nOPL=\\int n(\\textbf{r})ds\n\\]\nThe path length \\(ds\\) can be given in terms of two coordinates \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) parametrized by \\(\\lambda\\) such that\n\\[\nds=\\sqrt{\\dot{x}_1^{2}+\\dot{x}_2^{2}}d\\lambda\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\dot{x}_1=\\frac{dx_{1}}{d\\lambda}\\). We can therefore write Fermat’s principle as\n\\[\n\\delta OPL=\\int\\left[\\left(\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial x_i} \\delta x_i\\right) \\sqrt{\\dot{x}_1^2+\\dot{x}_2^2}+n \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\dot{x}_1^2+\\dot{x}_2^2}} \\dot{x}_i \\delta \\dot{x}_i\\right] d \\lambda = 0\n\\]\nTo evaluate this integral we would like to integrate by parts. We can write the integrand as \\[\nu = n \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\dot{x}_1^2+\\dot{x}_2^2}} \\dot{x}_i\n\\]\nand\n\\[\ndv = \\delta \\dot{x}_i d\\lambda\n\\]\nWe can now calculate \\(du\\) and \\(v\\) and obtain\n\\[\ndu = \\frac{d}{d\\lambda}\\left[n \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\dot{x}_1^2+\\dot{x}_2^2}} \\dot{x}_i\\right] d\\lambda\n\\]\nand\n\\[\nv = \\delta x_i\n\\]\nWith these expressions we can now apply the integration by parts formula \\(\\int u dv = uv - \\int v du\\), we get:\n\\[\n\\int n \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\dot{x}_1^2+\\dot{x}_2^2}} \\dot{x}_i \\delta \\dot{x}_i d\\lambda = \\left[n \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\dot{x}_1^2+\\dot{x}_2^2}} \\dot{x}_i \\delta x_i\\right]|_{\\lambda_1}^{\\lambda_2} - \\int \\delta x_i \\frac{d}{d\\lambda}\\left[n \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\dot{x}_1^2+\\dot{x}_2^2}} \\dot{x}_i\\right] d\\lambda\n\\]\nThis can be substituted back into the original equation to obtain\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\delta OPL &= \\int \\left[\\left(\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial x_i} \\delta x_i\\right) \\sqrt{\\dot{x}_1^2+\\dot{x}_2^2}\\right] d\\lambda \\\\\n&+ \\left[n \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\dot{x}_1^2+\\dot{x}_2^2}} \\dot{x}_i \\delta x_i\\right]|_{\\lambda_1}^{\\lambda_2} \\\\\n&- \\int \\delta x_i \\frac{d}{d\\lambda}\\left[n \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\dot{x}_1^2+\\dot{x}_2^2}} \\dot{x}_i\\right] d\\lambda = 0\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nAfter rearranging the terms we get\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\delta OPL &= \\int \\left\\{\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial x_i} \\sqrt{\\dot{x}_1^2+\\dot{x}_2^2} - \\frac{d}{d\\lambda}\\left[n \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\dot{x}_1^2+\\dot{x}_2^2}} \\dot{x}_i\\right]\\right\\} \\delta x_i d\\lambda \\\\\n&+ \\left[n \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\dot{x}_1^2+\\dot{x}_2^2}} \\dot{x}_i \\delta x_i\\right]|_{\\lambda_1}^{\\lambda_2} = 0\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nand therefore finally\n\\[\n\\delta OPL=\\int\\left[\\left(\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial x_i}\\right) \\sqrt{\\dot{x}_1{ }^2+\\dot{x}_2{ }^2}-\\frac{d}{d \\lambda}\\left(n \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\dot{x}_1^2+\\dot{x}_2^2}} \\dot{x}_i\\right)\\right] \\delta x_i d \\lambda+\\text { boundary terms }\n\\]\nfor which we choose the parameter \\(\\lambda\\) such that the boundary terms vanish.\n\\[\n\\lambda=s\n\\]\nsuch that\n\\[\n\\sqrt{\\dot{x}_1^2+\\dot{x}_2^2}=1\n\\]\nand finally leads to the Euler-Lagrange equation\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial x_i}\\right)-\\frac{d}{d s}\\left(n \\dot{x}_i\\right)=0\n\\]\nwhich is the differential form of the Fermat’s principle.",

    "text": "Historical Context of Refraction\n\n\n\n\n\nThe understanding of refraction has evolved over centuries, with contributions from various cultures and scientific traditions. This timeline highlights key milestones in the discovery and formalization of refraction, showcasing how our comprehension of this fundamental optical phenomenon has deepened over time:\n\nAncient Greece (3rd century BCE): Euclid noticed that a stick partially submerged in water appears bent. Archimedes studied the refraction of light in water.\nAncient Rome (1st century CE): Ptolemy conducted experiments on refraction and compiled tables of refraction angles for different media.\nIslamic Golden Age (10th-11th centuries): Ibn Sahl (940-1000) discovered the law of refraction, describing it geometrically. Alhazen (965-1040) studied lenses and the human eye, contributing significantly to optics.\nMiddle Ages: Robert Grosseteste (1175-1253) and Roger Bacon (1214-1294) studied refraction and its application to lenses.\nRenaissance: Thomas Harriot (1560-1621) rediscovered the law of refraction but didn’t publish his findings.\n17th Century: Willebrord Snellius (1580-1626) derived the mathematical law of refraction (Snell’s law) around 1621. René Descartes (1596-1650) independently derived and published the law of refraction in 1637. Pierre de Fermat (1607-1665) derived the law of refraction using his principle of least time.\n19th Century: Augustin-Jean Fresnel (1788-1827) developed the wave theory of light, explaining refraction in terms of changes in wave speed.\n20th Century: The quantum mechanical understanding of light, which emerged in the early 20th century, significantly impacted our view of refraction. Max Planck’s work on black body radiation in 1900 and Albert Einstein’s explanation of the photoelectric effect in 1905 laid the groundwork for the quantum nature of light. This quantum perspective provided a complementary explanation to the wave theory, describing refraction in terms of photons interacting with the atoms in the medium. While this quantum view offers insights into certain aspects of refraction, it’s important to note that both the wave and particle descriptions of light are necessary for a complete understanding of optical phenomena.\n\n\n\n\nThe law of refraction is the second important law of geometrical optics. It relates the refractive index \\(n_1\\) and angle of incidence \\(\\theta_1\\) on one side of an interface to the refractive index \\(n_2\\) and angle of refraction \\(\\theta_2\\) on the other side. Both the law of reflection and the law of refraction can be derived from more fundamental principles such as Fermat’s principle of least time and are consistent with the conservation of energy. Their relation to momentum is more complex and involves considering the interaction of light with the medium at an atomic level. These laws provide a mathematical framework for predicting how light behaves when it encounters interfaces between different media, forming the basis for understanding a wide range of optical phenomena and the design of optical devices.\n\n\nThe refractive index \\(n\\) is a material constant representing the factor by which the speed of light is reduced in the medium compared to its speed in vacuum. For most natural materials and visible light, the refractive index is \\(n \\ge 1\\), as light typically travels slower in media than in vacuum. However, in certain special cases—such as for X-rays in some materials or in engineered metamaterials—the refractive index can be less than 1 or even negative. Understanding these exotic cases requires a deeper exploration of the electromagnetic properties of materials and the origin of the refractive index, which we will address later.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaw of Refraction (Snell’s Law)\n\n\n\nThe law of refraction (Snell’s law) is given for the above sketch by the equation:\n\\[\nn_1 \\sin(\\theta_1)=n_2 \\sin(\\theta_2)\n\\]\n\n\nYou can explore the law of refraction using the interactive visualization below. The visualization shows a light ray incident on an interface between two media with different refractive indices. You can adjust the angle of incidence and the refractive index of the first medium to see how the angle of refraction changes according to Snell’s law.\n\n\n\nIncident Angle: 45°\n\nRefractive Index n₁: 1.0\n\nRefractive Index n₂: 1.5\n\n\n\n\nSnell’s law leads to some general patterns in the behavior of light rays at interfaces, which are worth remembering. Consider these two cases:\n\nWhen light moves from a medium with lower refractive index to one with higher refractive index (\\(n_1 &lt; n_2\\)):\n\nThe refracted ray bends towards the normal (optical axis)\nThe angle of refraction is smaller than the angle of incidence (\\(\\theta_2 &lt; \\theta_1\\))\n\nWhen light moves from a medium with higher refractive index to one with lower refractive index (\\(n_1 &gt; n_2\\)):\n\nThe refracted ray bends away from the normal (optical axis)\nThe angle of refraction is larger than the angle of incidence (\\(\\theta_2 &gt; \\theta_1\\))\n\n\nFigure 1 illustrates these principles with three plots showing how the refracted angle changes with the incident angle for two common interface scenarios: glass-to-air and air-to-glass. These plots clearly demonstrate the different behaviors described above.\n\n\n\nCode\ndef snell(n1, n2, theta1):\n    sin_theta2 = n1 * np.sin(theta1) / n2\n    theta2 = np.arcsin(np.clip(sin_theta2, -1, 1))\n    theta2[sin_theta2 &gt; 1] = np.nan\n    return theta2\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(4, 4))\n\ntheta1 = np.linspace(0, np.pi/2, 1000)\n\ntheta2_1_to_1_5 = snell(1.0, 1.5, theta1)\ntheta2_1_5_to_1 = snell(1.5, 1.0, theta1)\ntheta2_1_to_1 = snell(1.0, 1.0, theta1)\n\nax.plot(np.degrees(theta1), np.degrees(theta2_1_to_1_5), color='blue')\nax.plot(np.degrees(theta1), np.degrees(theta2_1_5_to_1), color='red')\nax.plot(np.degrees(theta1), np.degrees(theta2_1_to_1), color='green', linestyle='--')\n\nax.set_xlabel(r'$\\theta_1$ [°]')\nax.set_ylabel(r'$\\theta_2$ [°]')\nax.set_xlim(0, 90)\nax.set_ylim(0, 90)\n\nax.plot([0, 90], [0, 90], color='gray', linestyle=':', label='y=x')\n\nax.annotate(r'$\\frac{n_2}{n_1}=1.5$', xy=(60, 35), xytext=(50, 20),\n            arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle='-&gt;'), color='blue')\nax.annotate(r'$\\frac{n_1}{n_2}=1.5$', xy=(30, 50), xytext=(10, 70),\n            arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle='-&gt;'), color='red')\nax.annotate(r'$\\frac{n_2}{n_1}=1$', xy=(45, 45), xytext=(65, 50),\n            arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle='-&gt;'), color='green')\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1— Snell’s law for different combinations of refractive indices. The plots show the relationship between incident angle (\\(\\theta_1\\)) and refracted angle (\\(\\theta_2\\)) for three scenarios: (a) light passing from air to glass, (b) light passing from glass to air, and (c) a comparison of both cases. Note how the curves differ when light moves into a medium with higher refractive index versus a lower refractive index.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above diagram reveals a special case occurring when \\(n_1 &gt; n_2\\). Under these conditions, we can increase the incident angle \\(\\theta_1\\) until the outgoing angle reaches \\(\\theta_2 = \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\). At this point, the refracted ray would be traveling along the interface between the two media. For any incident angle \\(\\theta_1\\) larger than this critical angle, there is no refracted ray at all; instead, we observe only a reflected ray. This phenomenon, known as total internal reflection, occurs despite the fact that the material with refractive index \\(n_2\\) is completely transparent.\nLet’s formalize this concept mathematically. Using Snell’s law and setting \\(\\theta_2 = \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\), we obtain the equation for the critical angle \\(\\theta_c\\):\n\\[\\theta_1 = \\theta_c = \\sin^{-1}\\left(\\frac{n_2}{n_1}\\right)\\]\nNote that the \\(\\sin^{-1}()\\) function requires an argument \\(\\le 1\\), which is why this phenomenon only occurs when \\(n_2 &lt; n_1\\).\nIt’s important to understand that during total internal reflection, all of the light energy is reflected back into the first medium, hence the term ‘total’. However, electromagnetic optics reveals an interesting subtlety: an evanescent wave penetrates a short distance into the second medium, though it doesn’t propagate energy across the boundary.\nWhen the incident angle exceeds the critical angle, Snell’s law as we’ve written it no longer applies. Instead, we observe perfect reflection, where the angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence, just as in regular reflection from a mirror. This reflection occurs without any loss of energy to the second medium, making it an extremely efficient process.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Internal Reflection\n\n\n\nTotal internal reflection occurs when light is passing from higher refractive index to lower refractive index materials for incidence angle larger than a critical angle\n\\[\n\\theta_c=\\sin^{-1}\\left (\\frac{n_2}{n_1}\\right )\n\\]\n\n\nWe can demonstrate total internal reflection very easily with a water basin, for example, where we couple in light from a laser from the side.\n \nBut you could try that yourself also in the bath tub diving below the water surface.\nTotal internal reflection has numerous practical applications:\n\nFiber optic communications: Light signals can travel long distances with minimal loss through optical fibers.\nOptical instruments: Prisms in binoculars and telescopes use total internal reflection to manipulate light paths.\nGemstones: The sparkle of diamonds is enhanced by total internal reflection trapping light within the stone.\nMedical endoscopes: Total internal reflection helps guide light through flexible tubes for internal imaging.\n\nOptical Fibers and Total Internal Reflection\nTotal internal reflection plays a crucial role in modern telecommunications, particularly in optical fibers, which are also part of many experimental setups. These fibers are essentially ultra-thin glass wires, ranging in diameter from a few micrometers to several hundred micrometers, designed to transport light over long distances with minimal loss.\nThe structure of an optical fiber is key to its function:\n\nCore: A central glass core with a refractive index \\(n_1\\)\nCladding: A surrounding layer with a slightly lower refractive index \\(n_2\\)\n\nThis difference in refractive indices is what allows total internal reflection to occur within the fiber.\n \nFor light to propagate effectively through the fiber, it must enter at an angle that ensures total internal reflection at the core-cladding interface. This leads to the concept of the acceptance angle, \\(\\theta_a\\), which is the maximum angle at which light can enter the fiber and still undergo total internal reflection.\nTo characterize this acceptance angle, optical engineers use a parameter called the Numerical Aperture (NA).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumerical Aperture\n\n\n\nThe Numerical Aperture of a fiber is defined as the sine of the maximum acceptance angle:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nNA = \\sin(\\theta_a) = \\sqrt{n_1^2 - n_2^2}\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\n\nThis equation relates the NA directly to the refractive indices of the core and cladding. The derivation of this formula involves applying Snell’s law at the air-fiber interface and at the core-cladding interface, then using the condition for total internal reflection.\nIn practice, typical values for the refractive indices might be \\(n_1 = 1.475\\) for the core and \\(n_2 = 1.46\\) for the cladding. Plugging these into our equation:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nNA = \\sqrt{1.475^2 - 1.46^2} \\approx 0.2\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThis means that light entering the fiber within a cone of about 11.5° (arcsin(0.2)) from the fiber’s axis will be transmitted through the fiber via total internal reflection.\nThe NA is an important parameter in fiber optic design:\n\nIt determines the light-gathering ability of the fiber.\nIt affects the fiber’s bandwidth and its susceptibility to certain types of signal distortion.\nIt influences how easily the fiber can be coupled to light sources and other fibers.\n\nOptical fibers come in various types, each optimized for different applications. Some fibers are designed to transmit light over long distances with minimal loss, while others are engineered for specific wavelengths or to guide light in unusual ways. The figure below shows a few examples of optical fiber types.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2— Rendering of different optical fibers types (from left to right): Hollow core optical fiber, hollow core bragg fiber, photonic crystal fiber, conventional fiber\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile before we have considered Fermat’s principle for the special case of refraction and light propagation in a homogeneous medium, we can define a more general version of it correponding to the following situation also involving an inhomogeneous refractive index \\(n(\\vec{r})\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3— Sketch for a general description of Fermat’s principle\n\n\n\nFor this general scenario of light traveling along a path, we can define an optical path length (OPL) as\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\text{OPL} = \\int\\limits_{A}^{C} n(\\mathbf{r}) \\mathrm ds=0,\n\\end{equation}\\]\nwith a varying refractive index \\(n(\\mathbf{r})\\). Fermat’s Principle states that the actual path taken by the light makes the OPL stationary:\n\\[\n\\delta \\left( \\int_A^B n(\\mathbf{r}) \\, ds \\right) = 0\n\\]\nUsing the calculus of variations, this leads to the Euler-Lagrange equation for the path of light. In Cartesian coordinates, if the path is parameterized by \\(\\mathbf{r}(s) = (x(s), y(s), z(s))\\), the Euler-Lagrange equations become:\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{ds} \\left( n \\frac{d\\mathbf{r}}{ds} \\right) = \\nabla n\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\nabla n\\) is the gradient of the refractive index. This equation describes how the light ray bends in response to changes in the refractive index of the medium.\nFermat’s Principle is a cornerstone of geometrical optics and has applications in designing optical systems, understanding mirages, and analyzing the behavior of light in various media.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFermat’s Principle and Snells Law\n\n\n\n\n\nWe would like to apply Fermat’s principle to derive Snell’s law, which is a more lengthy calculation. To do this, we consider a light ray traveling from point \\(A\\) in medium 1 (with refractive index \\(n_1\\)) to point \\(C\\) in medium 2 (with refractive index \\(n_2\\)), crossing the interface at point \\(B\\). Let the coordinates of points \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) be \\((x_A, y_A)\\), \\((x_B, y_B)\\), and \\((x_C, y_C)\\), respectively. Assume the interface between the two media is at \\(y = y_B\\). The optical path length (OPL) is given by:\n\\[\n\\delta \\int_{A}^{C} n(\\vec{r}) \\, ds = 0,\n\\]\nwhere \\(n(\\vec{r})\\) is the refractive index at position \\(\\vec{r}\\), and \\(ds\\) is an infinitesimal element of the path.\nConsider a light ray traveling from point \\(A\\) in medium 1 (with refractive index \\(n_1\\)) to point \\(C\\) in medium 2 (with refractive index \\(n_2\\)), crossing the interface at point \\(B\\). Let the coordinates of points \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) be \\((x_A, y_A)\\), \\((x_B, y_B)\\), and \\((x_C, y_C)\\), respectively. Assume the interface between the two media is at \\(y = y_B\\).\n\n\nThe optical path length (OPL) is given by:\n\\[\n\\text{OPL} = n_1 \\int_{A}^{B} ds_1 + n_2 \\int_{B}^{C} ds_2,\n\\]\nwhere \\(ds_1\\) and \\(ds_2\\) are the infinitesimal path lengths in media 1 and 2, respectively.\n\n\n\nThe path lengths \\(ds_1\\) and \\(ds_2\\) can be expressed in terms of the coordinates:\n\\[\nds_1 = \\sqrt{(dx_1)^2 + (dy_1)^2}, \\quad ds_2 = \\sqrt{(dx_2)^2 + (dy_2)^2}.\n\\]\nSince the interface is at \\(y = y_B\\), we have \\(dy_1 = y_B - y_A\\) and \\(dy_2 = y_C - y_B\\). The total optical path length is:\n\\[\n\\text{OPL} = n_1 \\sqrt{(x_B - x_A)^2 + (y_B - y_A)^2} + n_2 \\sqrt{(x_C - x_B)^2 + (y_C - y_B)^2}.\n\\]\n\n\n\nTo find the stationary path, we take the variation of the OPL with respect to \\(x_B\\):\n\\[\n\\delta \\text{OPL} = \\delta \\left[ n_1 \\sqrt{(x_B - x_A)^2 + (y_B - y_A)^2} + n_2 \\sqrt{(x_C - x_B)^2 + (y_C - y_B)^2} \\right] = 0.\n\\]\nTaking the derivative with respect to \\(x_B\\):\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_B} \\left[ n_1 \\sqrt{(x_B - x_A)^2 + (y_B - y_A)^2} + n_2 \\sqrt{(x_C - x_B)^2 + (y_C - y_B)^2} \\right] = 0.\n\\]\n\n\n\nDifferentiating each term separately:\n\\[\nn_1 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_B} \\sqrt{(x_B - x_A)^2 + (y_B - y_A)^2} + n_2 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_B} \\sqrt{(x_C - x_B)^2 + (y_C - y_B)^2} = 0.\n\\]\nUsing the chain rule:\n\\[\nn_1 \\frac{x_B - x_A}{\\sqrt{(x_B - x_A)^2 + (y_B - y_A)^2}} + n_2 \\frac{x_B - x_C}{\\sqrt{(x_C - x_B)^2 + (y_C - y_B)^2}} = 0.\n\\]\n\n\n\nLet \\(\\theta_1\\) be the angle of incidence and \\(\\theta_2\\) be the angle of refraction.

The path of light in such a medium can be found by using Fermat’s principle in differential form:\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{ds}\\left (n(\\textbf{r})\\frac{d\\textbf{r}}{ds}\\right)=\\nabla n(\\textbf{r})\n\\]\nTypically, this requires to express the coordinates in terms of a parameter, such as \\(x(s)\\) and \\(y(s)\\), and then solve the differential equation. The solution will give the path of light in the medium. This is difficult and commonly done numerically. In paraxial optics, when the light is propagating roughly in the direction of \\(z\\), the differential element \\(ds\\) can be approximated as \\(dz\\) since then\n\\[\nds=dz\\sqrt{1+\\left (\\frac{dy}{dz}\\right )^2+\\left (\\frac{dx}{dz}\\right)^2}\\approx dz\n\\]\nwhich yields\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{dz}\\left (n\\frac{dx}{dz}\\right)\\approx \\frac{dn}{dx}\n\\]\nand\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{dz}\\left (n\\frac{dy}{dz}\\right )\\approx \\frac{dn}{dy}\n\\]\nThis readily yields the path of light in a homogeneous medium, where \\(n\\) is constant. In this case we have\n\\[\n\\frac{d^2 x}{dz^2}=\\frac{d^2 y}{dz^2}=0\n\\]\nwhich is true for a straight line. In a graded-index medium, the path of light can be found by solving the differential equation\n\\[\n\\frac{d^2 y}{dz^2}=-\\alpha^2 y\n\\]\nwhich is reminiscent of the equation of motion of a harmonic oscillator. The solution is therefore an oscillating function\n\\[\ny(z)=y_0\\cos(\\alpha z)+\\frac{\\theta_0}{\\alpha}\\sin(\\alpha z  )\n\\]\nwhere the angle \\(\\theta_0\\) is the initial angle of the light ray with respect to the \\(z\\) axis. This solution describes the path of light in a graded-index medium.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFermats’s Principle in Integral and Differential Form\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have described Fermat’t principle in an integral form specifiying the optical path length \\(S\\) as\n\\[\nOPL=\\int n(\\textbf{r})ds\n\\]\nThe path length \\(ds\\) can be given in terms of two coordinates \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) parametrized by \\(\\lambda\\) such that\n\\[\nds=\\sqrt{\\dot{x}_1^{2}+\\dot{x}_2^{2}}d\\lambda\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\dot{x}_1=\\frac{dx_{1}}{d\\lambda}\\). We can therefore write Fermat’s principle as\n\\[\n\\delta OPL=\\int\\left[\\left(\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial x_i} \\delta x_i\\right) \\sqrt{\\dot{x}_1^2+\\dot{x}_2^2}+n \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\dot{x}_1^2+\\dot{x}_2^2}} \\dot{x}_i \\delta \\dot{x}_i\\right] d \\lambda = 0\n\\]\nTo evaluate this integral we would like to integrate by parts. We can write the integrand as \\[\nu = n \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\dot{x}_1^2+\\dot{x}_2^2}} \\dot{x}_i\n\\]\nand\n\\[\ndv = \\delta \\dot{x}_i d\\lambda\n\\]\nWe can now calculate \\(du\\) and \\(v\\) and obtain\n\\[\ndu = \\frac{d}{d\\lambda}\\left[n \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\dot{x}_1^2+\\dot{x}_2^2}} \\dot{x}_i\\right] d\\lambda\n\\]\nand\n\\[\nv = \\delta x_i\n\\]\nWith these expressions we can now apply the integration by parts formula \\(\\int u dv = uv - \\int v du\\), we get:\n\\[\n\\int n \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\dot{x}_1^2+\\dot{x}_2^2}} \\dot{x}_i \\delta \\dot{x}_i d\\lambda = \\left[n \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\dot{x}_1^2+\\dot{x}_2^2}} \\dot{x}_i \\delta x_i\\right]|_{\\lambda_1}^{\\lambda_2} - \\int \\delta x_i \\frac{d}{d\\lambda}\\left[n \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\dot{x}_1^2+\\dot{x}_2^2}} \\dot{x}_i\\right] d\\lambda\n\\]\nThis can be substituted back into the original equation to obtain\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\delta OPL &= \\int \\left[\\left(\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial x_i} \\delta x_i\\right) \\sqrt{\\dot{x}_1^2+\\dot{x}_2^2}\\right] d\\lambda \\\\\n&+ \\left[n \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\dot{x}_1^2+\\dot{x}_2^2}} \\dot{x}_i \\delta x_i\\right]|_{\\lambda_1}^{\\lambda_2} \\\\\n&- \\int \\delta x_i \\frac{d}{d\\lambda}\\left[n \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\dot{x}_1^2+\\dot{x}_2^2}} \\dot{x}_i\\right] d\\lambda = 0\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nAfter rearranging the terms we get\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\delta OPL &= \\int \\left\\{\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial x_i} \\sqrt{\\dot{x}_1^2+\\dot{x}_2^2} - \\frac{d}{d\\lambda}\\left[n \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\dot{x}_1^2+\\dot{x}_2^2}} \\dot{x}_i\\right]\\right\\} \\delta x_i d\\lambda \\\\\n&+ \\left[n \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\dot{x}_1^2+\\dot{x}_2^2}} \\dot{x}_i \\delta x_i\\right]|_{\\lambda_1}^{\\lambda_2} = 0\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nand therefore finally\n\\[\n\\delta OPL=\\int\\left[\\left(\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial x_i}\\right) \\sqrt{\\dot{x}_1{ }^2+\\dot{x}_2{ }^2}-\\frac{d}{d \\lambda}\\left(n \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\dot{x}_1^2+\\dot{x}_2^2}} \\dot{x}_i\\right)\\right] \\delta x_i d \\lambda+\\text { boundary terms }\n\\]\nfor which we choose the parameter \\(\\lambda\\) such that the boundary terms vanish.\n\\[\n\\lambda=s\n\\]\nsuch that\n\\[\n\\sqrt{\\dot{x}_1^2+\\dot{x}_2^2}=1\n\\]\nand finally leads to the Euler-Lagrange equation\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial x_i}\\right)-\\frac{d}{d s}\\left(n \\dot{x}_i\\right)=0\n\\]\nwhich is the differential form of the Fermat’s principle.",

    "title": "Thin Film Interference",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The reflection and transmission of waves on a thin film can also be regarded as an interference of two waves. A light wave is incident on a thin film as depicted below. A part of the wave is reflected on the first boundary (1). Another part is transmitted through the first boundary and reflected at the second boundary to be transmitted in the same direction (2) as the first reflected part. Note that the lines and arrows denote the direction of the wavevector \\(\\vec{k}\\) of the partial waves.\nThis picture of a single reflection at each of the interfaces is certainly a simplification and in general we would have to consider an infinite number of reflections. But if we assume that the reflection is weak (e.g. 4% as for the air/glass interface), then the next reflection would just diminish the 4% to 4% of 4%, which is really weak. So the two wave interference may be a good model for weak reflections.\nFor the geometry shown in the figure above, we have just have a medium with \\(n_1\\) surrounding the film with \\(n_2\\). For this situation, we may calculate the path difference \\(\\Delta s\\), the waves 1 and 2 have to travel.\nWe find\n\\[\n\\Delta s=\\frac{2nd}{\\cos(\\beta)}-2d\\tan(\\beta)\\sin(\\alpha)\n\\]\nwhere the first term contains the distance traveled by wave 2 inside the water film. The second term is the additional distance wave 1 has to travel after being reflected which is indicated by the dotted line inbetween.\nWe can now introduce Snells law into the calculation, as Snells law must be also valid in wave optics and also in electromagnetic optics. With \\(n_1\\sin(\\alpha)=n_2\\sin(\\beta)\\) and setting \\(n_1=1\\) and \\(n_2=n\\) we can rewrite the path difference as\n\\[\n\\Delta s =\\frac{2nd}{\\cos(\\beta)}-\\frac{2nd\\sin^2(\\beta)}{\\cos(\\beta)}=2n d \\cos(\\beta)=2d\\sqrt{n^2-\\sin^2(\\alpha)}\n\\]\nWith that we can now also calculate the phase shift \\(\\Delta \\phi\\) that is introduced through the path difference, which reads\n\\[\n\\Delta \\phi=\\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}\\Delta s +\\pi\n\\]\nYou may now wonder about the second part \\(\\pi\\), which is not coming from a path difference. This addition phase shift occurs due to the reflection at an interface with higher refractive index. For such a reflection, there is always a phase jump of \\(\\phi\\), which we have to consider. This is not occuring for the reflection at the second boundary, as we there go from a higher refractive index to a lower one.\nTo get to know the properties of thin film interference a bit better we consider the normal incidence \\(\\alpha=0\\), which leaves us with\n\\[\n\\Delta \\phi=\\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}2dn+\\pi\n\\]\nIn case we are searching for constructive interference, this phase shift should correspond to an integer multiple of \\(2\\pi\\), e.g. \\(\\Delta \\phi =m2\\pi\\). From the last equation we see already, that for \\(d=0\\), we have in principle a residual phase shift of \\(\\pi\\), meaning that there is only destructive interference. Yet a film thickness of zeor does not really make sense.\nWe would like to discuss two different situations in the following in an example. For that we either look at the thickness under which a constructive interference at a wavelength of \\(\\lambda\\) occurs, or we ask what kind of wavelength do show constructive interference for a fixed thickness.\nFixed Wavelength\nFor a fixed wavelength of \\(\\lambda\\) we obtain a corresponding thickness for the constructive interference of\n\\[\nd=\\frac{(2m-1)\\lambda}{4n}\n\\]\nFixed Thickness\nFor a fixed thickness of \\(d\\) we obtain constructive interference at\n\\[\n\\lambda_{max}=\\frac{4nd}{2m-1}\n\\]\nWe can now have a look at two examples.\nExample 1 - d=100 nm\nIf we look at a film thickness of \\(d=100\\) nm and a film of \\(n=1.33\\), which corresponds to water we obbtain constructive interference for\n\\[\n\\lambda_{max}=\\frac{4\\cdot 100\\, {\\rm nm} \\cdot 1.33}{2m-1}\n\\]\nor\n\\[\n\\lambda_{max}=\\frac{ 532 {\\rm nm}}{2m-1}\n\\]\nwhich yields for different values of \\(m\\)\nand so on. We see therefore that the longest wavelength to create constructive interference is \\(532\\) nm, which is green light. The next longest wavelength is 177 nm, which is not visible anymore, so the reflection of a \\(d=100\\) nm film would look green. The left plot in the figure below shows the intensity distribution over wavelength where you recognize that the maximum is very broad.\nAn interesting effect is appearing, when the thickness of the water film get very thin. We may ask, when is no constructive interference observed. We therefore set the wavelength of the constructive interefence to \\(\\lambda_{max}=400\\, {\\rm nm}\\) and calculate the film thickness for which this occurs.\n\\[\nd=\\frac{(2m-1)\\lambda_{max}}{2n}\\approx 75\\, {\\rm nm}\n\\]\nSo for film thickness of water thinner than 75 nm, there is no constructive interference of the reflected light from the two boundaries in the visible region anymore. There will be still a reflection but no specific color. If the film gets even thinner, the intensity of the reflected light is further diminished by desctructive interference and whe obtain no reflection as shown on the right side of the above figure for a \\(d=10\\) nm film. Such thin films, which do not show any reflection are called Newton black films. You might have seen them, if you look closer at soap bubbles. They will show regions, which look like holes, but of course there are no holes in soap bubbles.\nIf the film gets thicker, e.g. \\(d=1\\) µm or even \\(d=100\\) µm, more than one constructive interference fits into the visible wavelength range. Due to that, the film may appear to have mixed colors or even look white. Below are the diagrams for those film thicknesses."

    "text": "Multiple Wave Interference\nSo far we looked at the interference of two waves, which was a simplification as I mentioned already earlier. Commonly there will be a multitude of partial waves contribute to the oberved intereference. This is what we would like to have a look at now. We will do that in a quite general fashion, as the resulting formulas will appear several times again for different problems.\nNevertheless we will make a difference between\n\nmultiwave interference of waves with the same amplitude\nmultiwave interference of waves with decreasing amplitude\n\nEspecially the latter is often occuring, if we have multiple reflections and each reflection is only a fraction of the incident amplitude.\n\nMultiple Wave Interference with Constant Amplitude\nIn the case of constant amplitude (for example realized by a grating, which we talk about later), the total wave amplitude is given according to the picture below by\n\\[\nU=U_1+U_2+U_1+U_3+\\ldots+U_M\n\\]\nwhere we sum the amplitude over \\(M\\) partial waves. Between the neighboring waves (e.g. \\(U_1\\) and \\(U_2\\)), we will assume a phase difference (because of a path length difference for example), which we denote as \\(\\phi\\).\nThe amplitude of the p-th wave is then given by\n\\[\nU_p=\\sqrt{I_0}e^{i(p-1)\\phi}\n\\]\nwith the index \\(p\\) being an interger \\(p=1,2,\\ldots,M\\), \\(h=e^{i\\phi}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{I_0}\\) as the amplitude of each individual wave. The total amplitude \\(U\\) can be then expressed as\n\\[\nU=\\sqrt{I_0}\\left (1+h+h^2+\\ldots +h^{M-1}\\right)\n\\]\nwhich is a geometric sum. We can apply the sum formula for geometric sums to obtain\n\\[\nU=\\sqrt{I_0}\\frac{1-h^M}{1-h}=\\sqrt{I_0}\\frac{1-e^{iM\\phi}}{1-e^{i\\phi}}\n\\]\nWe now have to calculate the intensity of the total amplitude\n\\[\nI=|U|^2=I_{0}\\left | \\frac{e^{-iM\\phi/2}-e^{iM\\phi/2}}{e^{-i\\phi/2}-e^{i\\phi/2}}\\right |^2\n\\]\nwhich we can further simplify to give\n\\[\nI=I_{0}\\frac{\\sin^2(M\\phi/2)}{\\sin^2(\\phi/2)}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig.: Multiple wave interefence. Left: Phase construction of a multiwave intereference with M equal amplitude waves. Middle: Intensity distribution obtained as a function of the phase shift \\(\\phi\\). Right: Examplary sketch of the interference generation.\n\n\n\nThe result is therefore an oscillating function. The numerator \\(\\sin^2(M\\phi/2)\\) shows and oscillation frequency, which is by a factor of \\(M\\) higher than the one in the denominator \\(\\sin^2\\phi/2)\\). Special situations occur, whenever the numerator and the denominator become zero. This will happen whenever\n\\[\n\\phi=m 2\\pi\n\\]\nwhere \\(m\\) is an integer and denotes the interference order, i.e. the number of wavelength that neighboring partial waves have as path length difference. In this case, the intensity distributiion will give us\n\\[\nI=I_0 \\frac{0}{0}\n\\]\nand we have to determine the limit with the help of l’Hospitals rule. The outcome of this calculation is, that\n\\[\nI(\\phi=m2\\pi)=M^2 I_0\n\\]\nwhich can be also realized when using the small angle approximation for the sine functions.\nSince he numerator is much faster oscillating then the denominator, we may also encounter the situation, where the numerator is zero, but the denomintor is not. These situations result in the additional minima between the primary maxima. We will have exactly \\(M-1\\) minima between the global maxima and \\(M-2\\) primary maxima. We will come back to these details when we talk about the diffraction grating in the next section.\n\n\nMultiple Wave Interference with Decreasing Amplitude\nWe will turn our attention now to a slight modification of the previous multiwave interference. We will introduce a decreasing amplitude of the individual waves. The first wave shall have an amplitude \\(U_1=\\sqrt{I_0}\\). The next wave, however, will not only be phase shifted but also have a smaller amplitude.\n\\[\nU_2=h U_1\n\\]\nwhere \\(h=re^{i\\phi}\\) with \\(|h|=r&lt;1\\). \\(r\\) can be regarded as a reflection coefficient, which deminishes the amplitude of the incident wave. According to that the intensity is reduced by\n\\[\nI_2=|U_2|^2=|h U_1|^2=r^2 I_1\n\\]\nThe intensity of the incident wave is multiplied by a factor \\(r^2\\), while the amplitude is multiplied by \\(r\\). Note that the phase factor \\(e^{i\\phi}\\) is removed when taking the square of this complex number.\n\nIntensity at Boundaries\nThe amplitude of the reflected wave is diminished by a factor \\(r\\le 1\\), which is called the reflection coefficient. The intensity is diminished by a factor \\(R=|r|^2\\le1\\), which is the reflectance.\nIn the absence of absorption, reflectance \\(R\\) and transmittance \\(T\\) add to one due to energy conservation.\n\\[\nR+T=1\n\\]\n\nConsequently, the third wave would be now \\(U_3=hU_2=h^2U_1\\). The total amplitude is thus\n\\[\nU=U_1+U_2+U_3+\\ldots+U_M = \\sqrt{I_0}(1+h+h^2+\\ldots)\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig.: Multiple wave interefence with decreasing amplitudes. Left: Phase construction of a multiwave intereference with M equal amplitude waves. Right: Intensity distribution obtained as a function of the phase shift \\(\\phi\\).\n\n\n\nThis yields again\n\\[\nU=\\sqrt{I_0}\\frac{(1-h^M)}{1-h}=\\frac{\\sqrt{I_0}}{1-r e^{i\\phi}}\n\\]\nCalculating the intensity of the waves is giving\n\\[\nI=|U|^2=\\frac{I_{0}}{|1-re^{i\\phi}|^2}=\\frac{I_0}{(1-r)^2+4r\\sin^2(\\phi/2)}\n\\]\nwhich is also known as the Airy function. This function can be further simplified by the following abbrevations\n\\[\nI_{\\rm max}=\\frac{I_0}{(1-r)^2}\n\\]\nand\n\\[\n\\mathcal{F}=\\frac{\\pi \\sqrt{r}}{1-r}\n\\]\nwhere the latter is called the Finesse. With those abbrevations, we obtain\n\\[\nI=\\frac{I_{\\rm max}}{1+4\\left(\\frac{\\mathcal{F}}{\\pi}\\right)\\sin^{2}(\\phi/2)}\n\\]\nfor the interference of multiple waves with decreasing amplitude.\nThis intensity distribution has a different shape than the one we obtained for multiple waves with the same amplitude.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig.: Multiple wave interference with decreasing amplitude. The graph shows the intensity distribution over the phase angle \\(\\phi\\) for different values of the Finesse \\(\\mathcal{F}\\).\n\n\n\nWe clearly observe that with increasing Finesse the intensity maxima, which occur at multiples fo \\(\\pi\\) get much narrower. In addition the regions between the maxima show better contrast and fopr higher Finesse we get complete destructive interference."

Here are the key developments in its history:\nAncient Times - 16th Century: Geometric Optics Dominance - Ancient civilizations understood basic reflection and refraction. - Focus was primarily on ray-based descriptions of light.\n1660s: Robert Hooke’s Wave Theory - Proposed that light might be a rapid vibrational motion. - Observed interference effects in thin films (“Newton’s Rings,” though named later).\n1690: Christiaan Huygens’ Wave Theory - Published “Traité de la Lumière” (Treatise on Light). - Introduced the concept of wavefronts. - Developed principle for wave propagation (Huygens’ Principle).\n1704: Newton’s “Opticks” - Despite observing interference effects, favored particle theory. - His authority led to wave theory being largely dismissed for nearly a century.\n1801: Thomas Young’s Double-Slit Experiment - Demonstrated interference of light definitively. - Measured wavelengths of different colors. - Introduced the concept of transverse waves.\n\n\n\nYoung’s double-slit experiment\n\n\n1818: Augustin-Jean Fresnel - Developed comprehensive mathematical theory of diffraction. - Explained polarization through transverse waves. - Created Fresnel equations for reflection and refraction.\nWave optics extends our understanding beyond the limitations of geometric optics by treating light as a wave phenomenon. This approach explains effects that cannot be accounted for by ray tracing alone, such as:\nLight is part of the electromagnetic spectrum, which spans an enormous range of frequencies. The visible region, extending approximately from 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red), represents only a small fraction of this spectrum. This wave description is essential for understanding many optical phenomena that geometric optics cannot explain, particularly when dealing with structures comparable in size to the wavelength of light.\nIn the following, we would like to introduce wave by discarding the fact, that light is related to electric and magnetic fields. This is useful as the vectorial nature of the electric and magnetic field further complicates the calculations, but we do not need those yet. Accordingly we also do not understand how light really interacts with matter and we therefore have to introduce some postulates as well."

In the same way as a microscope, the telescope consists of two lenses with the focal distances \\(f_1,f_2\\).\n\n\n\nKepler telescope with two biconvex lenses, creating a reversed image of distance objects.\n\n\nAs indicated in the sketch above, the first lens generates an image at the focal length of the first lens. This intermediate image is the magnified by an eye-piece as well acting as a magnifying glass. We may therefore apply the same kind of techniques as earlier for the calculation of the angular magnification. The angle of observation for the object of size \\(D\\) is given by\n\\[\n2\\epsilon_0=\\frac{D}{f_1}\n\\]\nwhile the angle of observation through the telescope is given as\n\\[\n2\\epsilon=\\frac{D}{f_2}\n\\]\nCorrespondingly, the angular magnification is given by\n\\[\nV=\\frac{\\epsilon}{\\epsilon_0}=\\frac{D}{f_2}\\frac{f_1}{D}=\\frac{f_1}{f_2}\n\\]\nThe magnification is therefore given by the ration of the focal length of the entrance lens and the eye-piece. The above telescope is also termed astronomical telescope or Kepler telescope, since it has been used for astromical observations. It creates an image which is reversed.\nA telescope with an upright image may be created with the help of a concave lens. This type of telescope is called Galilei telescope and obeyes the same magnification formula as above. Due to the fact that a concave lens has a negative focal length, the total magnification will be negative as well being indicative for an upright image.\n\n\n\nGalilei telescope for imaging objects into upright images with the help of a concave and a convex lens.\n\n\n\n\nReflecting Telescopes\nModern powerful telescopes also use mirrors instead of refracting optical elements, as reflecting elements with nearly 100 percent reflectivity can be built with a much smaller mass than large glass elements. Such telescopes come in different setups. The one below is a Cassegrain telescope, where a secondary convex miror is used for imaging the intermediate image to the eye.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReflective optics is commonly used in modern high quality telescopes for the advantage of weight. The image and sketch shows the optics of a so-called Cassegrain telescope.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdaptive Optics\nWhen observing objects from the ground, the atmosphere can distort the image. This is due to the fact that the atmosphere is not homogeneous and the refractive index of the air is changing with time. This leads to a distortion of the image, which can be corrected with the help of adaptive optics. The principle of adaptive optics is to measure the distortion of the image with the help of a laser beam and to correct the image with the help of a deformable mirror. The deformable mirror is a mirror with a number of actuators, which can change the shape of the mirror in order to correct the distortion of the image. The principle of adaptive optics is shown in the figure below.\n\n\n\nPrinciple of adaptive optics. The image of a star is distorted by the atmosphere. The distortion is measured with the help of a laser beam and corrected with the help of a deformable mirror.\n\n\n\n\nSpace-Based Telescopes\nPlacing telescopes in space eliminates atmospheric interference completely. The Hubble Space Telescope revolutionized astronomy with its crystal-clear views of the universe.\n\n\n\nLight path in the Hubble space telescope.\n\n\nIts successor, the James Webb Space Telescope (launched in 2021), operates in the infrared spectrum and can peer even further into space and time. Being above the atmosphere not only provides clearer images but also allows these telescopes to observe wavelengths that are normally blocked by Earth’s atmosphere, particularly in the infrared and ultraviolet regions.",

Achromatic lenses are typically constructed by combining two lenses with different optical properties: a biconvex lens made of crown glass (lower dispersion) bonded to a biconcave lens made of flint glass (higher dispersion). This combination allows for the correction of chromatic aberration.

One important example of such an aberration is “coma.”\nIn the case of coma, rays entering the lens at different heights with an angle to the optical axis do not converge to a single point in the image plane. Instead, they create a characteristic comet-shaped intensity distribution, where the light is asymmetrically distributed with a bright head and a diffuse tail pointing radially outward from the optical axis.

    "section": "Astigmatism",
    "text": "Astigmatism\nAstigmatism also occurs when imaging point sources located away from the optical axis. To understand this effect, we can analyze the rays from such a source by separating them into two categories:\n\nRays in the vertical (meridional) plane\nRays in the perpendicular (sagittal) plane\n\nAnalysis shows that meridional rays focus at a point closer to the lens compared to sagittal rays. This difference in focal positions creates a characteristic pattern in the image: when moving a screen through the focal region, the image of a point source transforms from a horizontal ellipse, through a circular point (at the circle of least confusion), to a vertical ellipse. This variation in image shape occurs because the focal surfaces for the meridional and sagittal rays are curved differently and intersect only at points along the optical axis.\nThe distance between these two focal surfaces increases with the distance from the optical axis, making astigmatism particularly noticeable for off-axis object points. This aberration is especially significant in systems where the object plane is not perpendicular to the optical axis or when using simple spherical lenses for wide-field imaging.\nFor an extended image as shown below, this results in the sperate focusing of vertical (left) and horizontal lines (right) in the image.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Sketch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Vertical Focus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Horizontal Focus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7— Astigmatism in optical systems.

Middle: Experimental image showing the focusing of vertical lines of a test object (letter “F”) at one focal position. Right: The same object at a different focal position where horizontal lines are in focus. This demonstrates how astigmatism causes different focal planes for vertical and horizontal features when a lens is tilted relative to the optical axis. The inability to focus both orientations simultaneously is a characteristic feature of astigmatic aberration.\n\n\n\nThis distortion, i.e. the elliptical shape of the focus has been used advatageously in single molecule microscopy to locate their position alsong the optical axis, which is typically a challenge for optical microscopy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAstigmatism\n\n\n\nAn optical aberration where rays from an off-axis point source focusing in two perpendicular planes (meridional and sagittal) have different focal lengths, resulting in image points that appear as ellipses oriented either horizontally or vertically, depending on the observation plane.\n\n\n\nDistortions\nBarrel or cushion shaped distortions in the image are found when inserting apertures in the optical path. This results in the removal of certain ray path ending up in field distortions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Cushion Distortion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Barrel Distortion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8— Geometric distortions in optical systems. Left: Cushion (or pincushion) distortion, where the magnification increases with distance from the optical axis, causing straight lines to bow inward and creating a cushion-like appearance. Right: Barrel distortion, where the magnification decreases with distance from the optical axis, causing straight lines to bow outward, resembling the shape of a barrel. These distortions maintain image sharpness but alter the geometric shape of the image, particularly noticeable in architectural photography or when imaging regular grid patterns.\n\n\n\nGeometric distortions arise from the position of the aperture relative to the lens and its effect on ray paths. This mechanism can be understood by analyzing how different rays contribute to image formation:\nWhen an aperture is placed behind the lens, rays that pass through create an image point \\(M_1\\) that is farther from the optical axis than the ideal image point \\(M\\) (where \\(M\\) is determined by the central ray from object point \\(A_0\\)). As the object point moves farther from the optical axis, the displacement between \\(M_1\\) and \\(M\\) increases proportionally. This progressive displacement transforms a regular grid pattern into a cushion (or pincushion) shape.\nConversely, when the aperture is placed in front of the lens, the opposite effect occurs. The rays that pass through the aperture create an image point closer to the optical axis than the ideal image point, resulting in barrel distortion. The magnitude of this displacement also increases with distance from the optical axis.\nThese theoretical predictions are confirmed by experimental observations, where:\n\nA rear aperture produces cushion distortion, causing straight lines to bow inward\nA front aperture produces barrel distortion, causing straight lines to bow outward\n\nThe severity of these distortions depends on both the aperture position and the distance of object points from the optical axis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9— Cushion (left) and barrel (right) type of distortions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCushion Distortion\n\n\n\nCushion Distortion (also called Pincushion Distortion) - An optical aberration where straight lines appear to bow inward toward the center of the image, like the sides of a cushion or pincushion.

This type of distortion is common in wide-angle lenses and makes the center of the image appear to bulge outward.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAberration Characterization and Zernike Polynomials\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Zernike polynomials are a set of orthonormal polynomials that are widely used in optics to describe wavefronts and to characterize optical aberrations. As we did not discuss wavefronts and waves yet, this is a more advanced topic here and only for information. Zernike polynomials are defined over the unit disk and are particularly useful because they are orthogonal under the inner product, which involves integration over the unit circle. This makes them suitable for decomposing a wavefront into a sum of orthogonal modes, each representing a different type of aberration.\nThe general form of the Zernike polynomials can be expressed in polar coordinates \\((\\rho, \\phi)\\), where \\(\\rho\\) is the radial distance from the origin (normalized to the unit circle) and \\(\\phi\\) is the azimuthal angle. The Zernike polynomials are defined as:\n\\[\nZ_n^m(\\rho, \\phi) =\n\\begin{cases}\nR_n^m(\\rho) \\cos(m\\phi) & \\text{for } m \\geq 0 \\\\\nR_n^{|m|}(\\rho) \\sin(|m|\\phi) & \\text{for } m &lt; 0\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nwhere \\(n\\) is a non-negative integer, \\(m\\) is an integer such that \\(n - |m|\\) is even and \\(0 \\leq |m| \\leq n\\), and \\(R_n^m(\\rho)\\) is the radial polynomial given by:\n\\[\nR_n^m(\\rho) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\frac{n-m}{2}} \\frac{(-1)^k (n-k)!}{k! \\left(\\frac{n+m}{2} - k\\right)! \\left(\\frac{n-m}{2} - k\\right)!} \\rho^{n-2k}\n\\]\nThe radial polynomials \\(R_n^m(\\rho)\\) are only dependent on the radial distance \\(\\rho\\), and they modulate the angular functions \\(\\cos(m\\phi)\\) and \\(\\sin(|m|\\phi)\\) that describe the azimuthal variation of the wavefront.\nThe Zernike polynomials are indexed in several ways, with one common method being the Noll index, which provides a single index \\(j\\) to each polynomial. Another method uses the pair \\((n, m)\\) to index the polynomials, where \\(n\\) indicates the order of the polynomial and \\(m\\) its azimuthal frequency.\nThese polynomials are particularly useful in optics and ophthalmology for describing the shape of optical wavefronts and the aberrations of optical systems, including the human eye. They allow for the decomposition of a complex wavefront into simpler, orthogonal components, each corresponding to a specific type of aberration, such as defocus, astigmatism, coma, etc.\nThe plots below visualize the Zernike Polynomials up to a certain order.\n\n\nCode\ndef radial_polynomial(n, m, rho):\n    \"\"\"\n    Compute the radial component of the Zernike polynomial.\n    \"\"\"\n    R = np.zeros_like(rho)\n    for k in range((n - abs(m)) // 2 + 1):\n        R += ((-1)**k * sp.factorial(n - k) /\n              (sp.factorial(k) * sp.factorial((n + abs(m)) // 2 - k) *\n              sp.factorial((n - abs(m)) // 2 - k))) * rho**(n - 2*k)\n    return R\n\ndef zernike_polynomial(n, m, rho, phi):\n    \"\"\"\n    Compute the Zernike polynomial.\n    \"\"\"\n    if m &gt;= 0:\n        return radial_polynomial(n, m, rho) * np.cos(m * phi)\n    else:\n        return radial_polynomial(n, -m, rho) * np.sin(-m * phi)\n\nx = np.linspace(-1, 1, 400)\ny = np.linspace(-1, 1, 400)\nxx, yy = np.meshgrid(x, y)\nrho = np.sqrt(xx**2 + yy**2)\nphi = np.arctan2(yy, xx)\n\nmask = rho &gt; 1\nrho[mask] = np.nan\n\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(3, 6, figsize=(8, 4))\naxs = axs.flatten()\n\nindex = 0\nfor n in range(6):\n    for m in range(-n, n+1, 2):\n        if index &gt;= len(axs):\n            break\n        Z = zernike_polynomial(n, m, rho, phi)\n        Z[mask] = np.nan  # Apply mask\n        ax = axs[index]\n        c = ax.imshow(Z, extent=(-1, 1, -1, 1), origin='lower')\n        ax.set_title(f'n={n}, m={m}')\n        ax.axis('off')\n        index += 1\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()"

We begin with Snell’s law for the geometry:\n\\[n_{1}\\sin(\\alpha+\\theta_1)=n_{2}\\sin(\\alpha-\\theta_2)\\]\nWe define key relationships:\n\\[\\sin(\\alpha)=\\frac{y}{R}, \\quad \\tan(\\theta_1)=\\frac{y}{a}, \\quad \\tan(\\theta_2)=\\frac{y}{b}\\]\nTo simplify this, we employ the paraxial approximation, which assumes all angles are small. This allows us to use first-order approximations of trigonometric functions, effectively linearizing them:\n\\[\\sin(\\theta) \\approx \\theta+ O(\\theta^{3}), \\quad \\tan(\\theta) \\approx \\theta + O(\\theta^{3}),\\quad \\cos(\\theta)\\approx 1 + O(\\theta^{2})\\]\nThis approach, common in optics, significantly simplifies our calculations while maintaining accuracy for most practical scenarios involving lenses.\nWith the help of these approximations we can write Snell’s law for the curved surface as\n\\[n_1(\\alpha+\\theta_1)=n_2(\\alpha-\\theta_2).\\]\nWith some slight transformation which you will find in the video of the online lecture we obtain, therefore,\n\\[\\theta_2=\\frac{n_2-n_1}{n_2 R}y -\\frac{n_1}{n_2}\\theta_1,\\]\nwhich is a purely linear equation in \\(y\\) and \\(\\theta_1\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParaxial Approximation\n\n\n\n\n\nThe paraxial approximation is a fundamental simplification in optics that assumes all angles are small. This allows us to use linear approximations for trigonometric functions, significantly simplifying calculations while maintaining accuracy for most practical scenarios involving lenses.\nTo visualize the validity of this approximation, let’s examine two plots:\n\nThe first plot compares sin(θ) (blue line) with its linear approximation θ (red dashed line) for angles ranging from 0 to π/2 radians.\nThe second plot shows the absolute error between sin(θ) and θ.\n\nThese plots demonstrate that:\n\nFor small angles (roughly up to 0.5 radians or about 30 degrees), the approximation is very close to the actual sine function.\nThe error increases rapidly for larger angles, indicating the limitations of the paraxial approximation.\n\nIn most optical systems, especially those involving lenses, the angles of incident and refracted rays are typically small enough for this approximation to be valid. However, it’s important to be aware of its limitations when dealing with wide-angle optical systems or scenarios where precision is critical.\n\n\nCode\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# Define the range of angles (in radians)\ntheta = np.linspace(0, np.pi/2, 1000)\n\n# Calculate sin(theta) and theta (linear approximation)\nsin_theta = np.sin(theta)\nlinear_approx = theta\n\n# Calculate the absolute error\nerror = np.abs(sin_theta - linear_approx)\n\n# Create the plot with two subplots side by side\nfig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(7.5, 4))\n\n# Plot sin(theta) and theta on the first subplot\nax1.plot(theta, sin_theta, label='sin(θ)', color='blue')\nax1.plot(theta, linear_approx, label='θ', color='red', linestyle='--')\nax1.set_xlabel(r'$\\theta$ [rad]')\nax1.set_ylabel(r'$\\sin(x),x$')\nax1.legend()\n\n# Plot the error on the second subplot\nax2.plot(theta, error, label='Absolute Error', color='green')\nax2.set_xlabel(r'$\\theta$ [rad]')\nax2.set_ylabel('|sin(θ) - θ|')\nax2.legend()\n\n# Adjust the layout and display the plot\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualization of the paraxial approximation plotting the \\(\\sin(\\theta)\\) and the linear approximation \\(\\theta\\) (dashed line) for angles ranging from 0 to \\(\\pi/2\\) radians.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider light originating from a point at distance \\(y\\) from the optical axis.

    "text": "Prisms are wedge-shaped optical elements made of a transparent material, such as glass. A special form of such a prism is an isosceles prism with two sides of equal length. The two equal sides enclose an angle \\(\\gamma\\), known as the apex angle of the prism. When light passes through this prism, it undergoes refraction twice.\nFirst, the incident angle \\(\\alpha_1\\) is changed into a refracted angle \\(\\beta_1\\) as the light enters the prism. This refracted ray then hits the second interface at an angle \\(\\beta_2\\), leading to a second refraction as it exits the prism at an angle \\(\\alpha_2\\).\nOf particular interest is the total deflection of the incident ray, which is measured by the angle \\(\\delta\\). This deflection angle represents the difference between the final outgoing angle \\(\\alpha_2\\) and the initial incident angle \\(\\alpha_1\\).\nUnderstanding how this deflection angle changes based on the prism’s properties and the incident angle is crucial in various optical applications. In the following sections, we will explore how to calculate this deflection angle and examine its dependence on different parameters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1— Refraction of rays on a prism.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can calculate the deflection angle \\(\\delta\\) from a number of considerations.

This readily yields\n\\[\\mathrm d \\alpha_2=-\\mathrm d\\alpha_1.\\]\nThis means a change in the incidence angle \\(\\mathrm d\\alpha_1\\) yields an opposite change in the outgoing angle \\(-\\mathrm d\\alpha_2\\). We may later observe that in the experiment.\nAs both, the incident and the outgoing angle are related to each other by Snells’s law, we may introduce the derivatives of Snell’s law for both interfaces, e.g.,\n\n\\(\\cos(\\alpha_1)\\mathrm d\\alpha_1=n\\cos(\\beta_1)\\mathrm d\\beta_1\\)\n\\(\\cos(\\alpha_2)\\mathrm d\\alpha_2=n\\cos(\\beta_2)\\mathrm d\\beta_2\\)\n\nwhere \\(n\\) is the refractive index of the prism material and the material outside is air (\\(n_{\\rm air}=1\\)). Replacing \\(\\cos(\\alpha)=\\sqrt{1-\\sin^2(\\alpha)}\\) and dividing the two previous equations by each other readily yields\n\\[\\frac{1-\\sin^2(\\alpha_1)}{1-\\sin^2(\\alpha_2)}=\\frac{n^2-\\sin^2(\\alpha_1)}{n^2-\\sin^2(\\alpha_2)}.\\]\nThe latter equation is for \\(n\\neq 1\\) only satisfied if \\(\\alpha_1=\\alpha_2=\\alpha\\). In this case, the light path through the prism must be symmetric and we may write down the minimum deflection angle \\(\\delta_{\\rm min}\\):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMinimum prism deflection\n\n\n\nThe minimum deflection angle of an isosceles prism with a prism angle \\(\\gamma\\) is given by\n\\[\\delta_{\\rm min}=2\\alpha-\\gamma.\\]\n\n\nGiven this minimum deflection angle \\(\\delta_{\\rm min}\\) and the properties of the prism, we may also write down Snell’s law using \\(\\sin(\\alpha)=n\\sin(\\beta)\\), which results in\n\\[\\sin \\left ( \\frac{\\delta_{\\rm min}+\\gamma}{2}\\right )=n\\sin\\left (\\frac{\\gamma}{2}\\right).\\]\nwhich indicates the dependence of the deflection in the refractive index \\(n\\) of the prism material.\n\n\n\nVery important applications now arise from the fact, that the refractive index is a material property, which depends on the color (frequency or wavelength) of light. We do not yet understand the origin of this dependence. The plots below show the wavelength dependence of three different glasses.

In this process, light with the longest wavelength (red) is deflected the least, while light with the shortest wavelength (violet) is deflected the most. This occurs because the refractive index of the prism material varies with wavelength, a phenomenon known as dispersion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5— Spectrum as created by a prism in the lecture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Spectrum\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Prism\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6— Deflection of different wavelengths of light in a prism with normal dispersion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis wavelength-dependent refraction is crucial as it forms the basis for spectroscopy, a powerful analytical technique that measures and records the intensity of light as a function of wavelength.

Here are some common uses of prisms:\n\n\nPorro prisms in traditional binoculars and roof prisms in modern designs serve to correct image inversion and provide a compact form. These prisms enable a longer optical path within a shorter physical length, enhancing magnification while maintaining portability. This design is crucial for both binoculars and some telescopes, offering users powerful magnification in a handheld device.\n\n\n\nRight-angle prisms are the key component in periscopes, redirecting light at 90-degree angles. This simple yet effective design allows viewers to see over obstacles or around corners, making periscopes invaluable in submarines and various military applications where direct line of sight is obstructed.\n\n\n\nCube beamsplitters play a vital role in dividing a single beam of light into two separate beams. This capability is essential in various scientific and medical applications, including interferometry, holography, and optical coherence tomography (OCT). The ability to split light beams precisely opens up numerous possibilities in research and diagnostics.\n\n\n\nRisley prisms, consisting of a pair of rotating wedge prisms, offer precise control over laser beam direction. This technology finds applications in laser scanning, target tracking, and adaptive optics. The ability to steer beams accurately is crucial in fields ranging from military applications to advanced scientific research.\n\n\n\nTotal Internal Reflection (TIR) prisms are a crucial component in Digital Light Processing (DLP) projectors. They direct light from the lamp to the Digital Micromirror Device (DMD) and then to the projection lens, enabling the high-quality image projection that DLP technology is known for.\n\n\n\nIn Single-Lens Reflex (SLR) cameras, pentaprisms play a critical role in the viewfinder system. They flip the image from the lens to appear upright and correctly oriented in the viewfinder, allowing photographers to accurately compose their shots.\n\n\n\nBrewster prisms find use in laser systems for polarization and wavelength separation. Additionally, dispersing prisms can be employed for wavelength tuning in certain laser setups, providing precise control over the laser’s output characteristics.\n\n\n\nIn the realm of telecommunications, prisms are utilized in some fiber optic connectors and switches. They help redirect light between fibers, playing a crucial role in maintaining signal integrity and enabling complex network architectures.\n\n\n\nFresnel lenses, a specialized type of prism, are employed in concentrated solar power systems. These lenses focus sunlight efficiently, contributing to the development of more effective solar energy collection technologies.\n\n\n\nPrisms are an integral part of HUD systems in both automotive and aviation contexts. They project crucial information onto the windshield or a combiner glass, allowing drivers or pilots to access important data without taking their eyes off their primary viewpoint.\n\n\n\nNomarski prisms enhance the capabilities of differential interference contrast microscopy. They increase contrast in transparent specimens, enabling scientists to observe details that would be difficult or impossible to see with conventional microscopy techniques.\n\n\n\nIn some OCT systems, prisms are employed for sample arm scanning and reference arm delay. This application of prisms contributes to the high-resolution imaging capabilities of OCT, which is particularly valuable in medical diagnostics, especially in ophthalmology.",

The total deflection angle \\(\\delta\\) is then\n\\[\\delta =\\alpha_1-\\beta_1+\\alpha_2-\\beta_2\\]\nor\n\\[\\delta =\\alpha_1+\\alpha_2-\\gamma\\]\nfrom which we obtain\n\\[\\delta=\\alpha_1+\\sin^{-1}\\left (\\frac{n_1}{n_0}\\sin\\left [\\gamma-\\sin^{-1}\\left (\\frac{n_0}{n_1}\\sin(\\alpha_1) \\right)\\right]\\right )-\\gamma\\]\nas the deflection angle.\n\n\nCode\ndef deflection(alpha_1,gamma,n0,n1):\n    g=gamma*np.pi/180\n    return(alpha_1+np.arcsin(n1*np.sin(g-np.arcsin(n0*np.sin(alpha_1)/n1))))-g\n\na_1=np.linspace(0.1,np.pi/2,100)\nplt.figure(figsize=(4,4))\nplt.plot(a_1*180/np.pi,deflection(a_1,45,1,1.5)*180/np.pi,label=r\"$\\gamma=45$ °\")\nplt.plot(a_1*180/np.pi,deflection(a_1,30,1,1.5)*180/np.pi,label=r\"$\\gamma=30$ °\")\nplt.plot(a_1*180/np.pi,deflection(a_1,10,1,1.5)*180/np.pi,label=r\"$\\gamma=10$ °\")\nplt.xlabel(r\"incindence angle $\\alpha_1$ [°]\")\nplt.ylabel(r\"deflection angle $\\delta$ [°]\")\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2— Deflection angle as a function of the incidence angle for different prism angles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we now would like to know how the deflection angle changes with the incident angle \\(\\alpha_1\\), we calculate the derivative of the deflection angle \\(\\delta\\) with respect to \\(\\alpha_1\\), i.e.,\n\\[\\frac{\\mathrm d\\delta}{\\mathrm d\\alpha_1}=1+\\frac{\\mathrm d\\alpha_2}{\\mathrm d \\alpha_1}.\\]\nWe are here especially interested in the case, where this change in deflection is reaching a minimum, i.e., \\(\\mathrm d\\delta/\\mathrm d\\alpha_1 =0\\). This readily yields\n\\[\\mathrm d \\alpha_2=-\\mathrm d\\alpha_1.\\]\nThis means a change in the incidence angle \\(\\mathrm d\\alpha_1\\) yields an opposite change in the outgoing angle \\(-\\mathrm d\\alpha_2\\). We may later observe that in the experiment.\nAs both, the incident and the outgoing angle are related to each other by Snells’s law, we may introduce the derivatives of Snell’s law for both interfaces, e.g.,\n\n\\(\\cos(\\alpha_1)\\mathrm d\\alpha_1=n\\cos(\\beta_1)\\mathrm d\\beta_1\\)\n\\(\\cos(\\alpha_2)\\mathrm d\\alpha_2=n\\cos(\\beta_2)\\mathrm d\\beta_2\\)\n\nwhere \\(n\\) is the refractive index of the prism material and the material outside is air (\\(n_{\\rm air}=1\\)). Replacing \\(\\cos(\\alpha)=\\sqrt{1-\\sin^2(\\alpha)}\\) and dividing the two previous equations by each other readily yields\n\\[\\frac{1-\\sin^2(\\alpha_1)}{1-\\sin^2(\\alpha_2)}=\\frac{n^2-\\sin^2(\\alpha_1)}{n^2-\\sin^2(\\alpha_2)}.\\]\nThe latter equation is for \\(n\\neq 1\\) only satisfied if \\(\\alpha_1=\\alpha_2=\\alpha\\). In this case, the light path through the prism must be symmetric and we may write down the minimum deflection angle \\(\\delta_{\\rm min}\\):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMinimum prism deflection\n\n\n\nThe minimum deflection angle of an isosceles prism with a prism angle \\(\\gamma\\) is given by\n\\[\\delta_{\\rm min}=2\\alpha-\\gamma.\\]\n\n\nGiven this minimum deflection angle \\(\\delta_{\\rm min}\\) and the properties of the prism, we may also write down Snell’s law using \\(\\sin(\\alpha)=n\\sin(\\beta)\\), which results in\n\\[\\sin \\left ( \\frac{\\delta_{\\rm min}+\\gamma}{2}\\right )=n\\sin\\left (\\frac{\\gamma}{2}\\right).\\]\nwhich indicates the dependence of the deflection in the refractive index \\(n\\) of the prism material.\n\n\n\nVery important applications now arise from the fact, that the refractive index is a material property, which depends on the color (frequency or wavelength) of light. We do not yet understand the origin of this dependence. The plots below show the wavelength dependence of three different glasses. You may find much more data on the refractive index of different materials in an online database.\n\n\nCode\nbk7=pd.read_csv(\"data/BK7.csv\",delimiter=\",\")\nsf10=pd.read_csv(\"data/SF10.csv\",delimiter=\",\")\nfk51a=pd.read_csv(\"data/FK51A.csv\",delimiter=\",\")\nplt.figure(figsize=(4,4))\nplt.plot(bk7.wl*1000,bk7.n,label=\"BK7\")\nplt.plot(sf10.wl*1000,sf10.n,label=\"SF10\")\nplt.plot(fk51a.wl*1000,fk51a.n,label=\"FK51A\")\nplt.xlim(300,900)\nplt.xlabel(\"wavelength [nm]\")\nplt.ylabel(\"refractive index n\")\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3— Refractive index of different glasses as a function of the wavelength.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nbk7=pd.read_csv(\"data/BK7.csv\",delimiter=\",\")\na_1=np.linspace(0.15,np.pi/2,100)\nplt.figure(figsize=(7.5,4))\nplt.subplot(1,2,1)\nfor wl in np.linspace(0.400,0.700,100):\n    n1=np.interp(wl,bk7.wl,bk7.n)\n    c=wavelength_to_rgb(wl*1000, gamma=0.8)\n    plt.plot(a_1*180/np.pi,deflection(a_1,45,1,n1)*180/np.pi,color=c)\n\nplt.xlabel(r\"incindence angle $\\alpha_1$ [°]\")\nplt.ylabel(r\"deflection angle $\\delta$ [°]\")\n\n\nplt.subplot(1,2,2)\nfor wl in np.linspace(0.400,0.700,100):\n    n1=np.interp(wl,bk7.wl,bk7.n)\n    c=wavelength_to_rgb(wl*1000, gamma=0.8)\n    plt.plot(a_1*180/np.pi,deflection(a_1,45,1,n1)*180/np.pi,color=c)\n\nplt.xlabel(r\"incindence angle $\\alpha_1$ [°]\")\nplt.ylabel(r\"deflection angle $\\delta$ [°]\")\nplt.xlim(30,45)\nplt.ylim(25,30)\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4— Deflection angle as a function of the incidence angle for different wavelengths.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plots have a general feature, which is that the refractive index is largest at small wavelength (blue colors), while it drops continuously with increasing wavelength towards the red (800 nm). If you would characterize the dependence by the slope, i.e., \\(\\mathrm dn/\\mathrm d\\lambda\\) then all displayed curves show in the visible range\n\n\\(\\frac{\\mathrm dn}{\\mathrm d\\lambda}&lt;0\\), is called normal dispersion\n\nwhile\n\n\\(\\frac{\\mathrm dn}{\\mathrm d\\lambda}&gt;0\\), is called anomalous dispersion\n\nThis wavelength dependence of the refractive index will yield a dependence of the deflection angle on the color of light as well. The change of the deflection angle with the refractive index can be calculated to be\n\\[\\frac{\\mathrm d\\delta}{\\mathrm d n}=\\frac{2\\sin(\\gamma/2)}{\\sqrt{1-n^2\\sin^2(\\gamma/2)}}\\]\ntogether with the relation\n\\[\\frac{\\mathrm d \\delta}{\\mathrm d \\lambda}=\\frac{\\mathrm d\\delta}{\\mathrm d n}\\frac{\\mathrm d n}{\\mathrm d\\lambda}\\]\nwe obtain\n\\[\\frac{\\mathrm d\\delta}{\\mathrm d\\lambda}=\\frac{2\\sin(\\gamma/2)}{\\sqrt{1-n^2\\sin^2(\\gamma/2)}}\\frac{\\mathrm d n}{\\mathrm d \\lambda}.\\]\nThe refraction of white light through a prism splits the different colors composing white light spatially into a colored spectrum. In this process, light with the longest wavelength (red) is deflected the least, while light with the shortest wavelength (violet) is deflected the most. This occurs because the refractive index of the prism material varies with wavelength, a phenomenon known as dispersion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5— Spectrum as created by a prism in the lecture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Spectrum\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Prism\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6— Deflection of different wavelengths of light in a prism with normal dispersion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis wavelength-dependent refraction is crucial as it forms the basis for spectroscopy, a powerful analytical technique that measures and records the intensity of light as a function of wavelength. Spectroscopy allows scientists to analyze the composition and properties of matter by examining its interaction with light across different wavelengths.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Principle of a prism spectrometer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Technical realization of a prism spectrometer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7— Principle and technical realization of a prism spectrometer.\n\n\n\nDIY prism\nIf you don’t have a prism at home (which most people don’t), you can create a simple substitute using a mirror and a basin of water. Here’s how:\n\nPlace a mirror in a basin of water, partially submerged.\nShine white light from a flashlight onto the mirror.\nObserve the reflected and refracted light, paying special attention to the edges.\n\nFor better results, you can create a small aperture by making a tiny hole in a piece of black paper and placing it in front of the flashlight.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8— Home made water prism.\n\n\n\nWhile the dependence of water’s refractive index on wavelength is relatively weak, it’s still sufficient to demonstrate the familiar colors of the rainbow. This phenomenon will be referenced later in our discussion.\n\n\nCode\n#\nh2o=pd.read_csv(\"data/H2O.csv\",delimiter=\",\")\nplt.figure(figsize=(6,4))\nplt.plot(h2o.wl*1000,h2o.n,label=r\"$H_2O$\")\nplt.xlim(300,900)\nplt.ylim(1.3,1.36)\nplt.xlabel(\"wavelength [nm]\")\nplt.ylabel(\"refractive index n\")\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9— Refractive index of water as a function of the wavelength.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplications of prims\n\n\n\n\n\nPrisms are versatile optical components with a wide range of applications across various fields. Here are some common uses of prisms:\n\n\nPorro prisms in traditional binoculars and roof prisms in modern designs serve to correct image inversion and provide a compact form. These prisms enable a longer optical path within a shorter physical length, enhancing magnification while maintaining portability. This design is crucial for both binoculars and some telescopes, offering users powerful magnification in a handheld device.\n\n\n\nRight-angle prisms are the key component in periscopes, redirecting light at 90-degree angles. This simple yet effective design allows viewers to see over obstacles or around corners, making periscopes invaluable in submarines and various military applications where direct line of sight is obstructed.\n\n\n\nCube beamsplitters play a vital role in dividing a single beam of light into two separate beams. This capability is essential in various scientific and medical applications, including interferometry, holography, and optical coherence tomography (OCT). The ability to split light beams precisely opens up numerous possibilities in research and diagnostics.\n\n\n\nRisley prisms, consisting of a pair of rotating wedge prisms, offer precise control over laser beam direction. This technology finds applications in laser scanning, target tracking, and adaptive optics. The ability to steer beams accurately is crucial in fields ranging from military applications to advanced scientific research.\n\n\n\nTotal Internal Reflection (TIR) prisms are a crucial component in Digital Light Processing (DLP) projectors. They direct light from the lamp to the Digital Micromirror Device (DMD) and then to the projection lens, enabling the high-quality image projection that DLP technology is known for.\n\n\n\nIn Single-Lens Reflex (SLR) cameras, pentaprisms play a critical role in the viewfinder system. They flip the image from the lens to appear upright and correctly oriented in the viewfinder, allowing photographers to accurately compose their shots.\n\n\n\nBrewster prisms find use in laser systems for polarization and wavelength separation. Additionally, dispersing prisms can be employed for wavelength tuning in certain laser setups, providing precise control over the laser’s output characteristics.\n\n\n\nIn the realm of telecommunications, prisms are utilized in some fiber optic connectors and switches. They help redirect light between fibers, playing a crucial role in maintaining signal integrity and enabling complex network architectures.\n\n\n\nFresnel lenses, a specialized type of prism, are employed in concentrated solar power systems. These lenses focus sunlight efficiently, contributing to the development of more effective solar energy collection technologies.\n\n\n\nPrisms are an integral part of HUD systems in both automotive and aviation contexts. They project crucial information onto the windshield or a combiner glass, allowing drivers or pilots to access important data without taking their eyes off their primary viewpoint.\n\n\n\nNomarski prisms enhance the capabilities of differential interference contrast microscopy. They increase contrast in transparent specimens, enabling scientists to observe details that would be difficult or impossible to see with conventional microscopy techniques.\n\n\n\nIn some OCT systems, prisms are employed for sample arm scanning and reference arm delay. This application of prisms contributes to the high-resolution imaging capabilities of OCT, which is particularly valuable in medical diagnostics, especially in ophthalmology.",

There are about 6 Million cones in the human eye.\nRods: More sensitive to light but do not distinguish colors, providing vision in low light conditions. There are around 12 Million rods in the human eye.\n\nRods and cones obtain their function from a chromophore molecule called retina, which undergoes a conformational change when exposed to light. This change triggers a cascade of chemical reactions that ultimately lead to the generation of neural signals. The color vision is achieved with the same chromophore molecule that is embedded in slightly different protein structures in cones. This allows cones to be sensitive to different wavelengths of light.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Distribution of cones and rods around the fovea, their microscopic structure, and spectral sensitivity.\n\n\n\nCones contain light-sensitive pigments based on retinal molecules, which undergo conformational changes when excited by light, triggering a cascade of chemical processes. There are three types of cones, each sensitive to different wavelengths of light, enabling color vision.\n\n\n\nVisual acuity, often measured using an eye chart, quantifies the eye’s ability to resolve fine details. It’s typically expressed as a fraction (e.g., 20/20 vision), where the numerator is the test distance and the denominator is the distance at which a person with normal acuity can read the same line.\nThe human eye’s remarkable performance in pattern recognition, depth perception, and adaptability to varying light conditions is achieved through the complex interplay of its optical components and neural processing. This sophisticated system continues to inspire developments in artificial vision systems and optical technologies.\n\n\n\nThe eye’s optical system is asymmetrical due to the different media it interfaces with (air on one side, vitreous humor on the other). This results in different focal lengths:\n\nFront focal length: \\(f_1 = 17\\) mm\nBack focal length: \\(f_2 = 22\\) mm\n\nThese values can change during accommodation for near vision:\n\nClose object front focal length: \\(f_1 = 14\\) mm\nClose object back focal length: \\(f_2 = 19\\) mm\n\nThe eye’s refractive power, measured in diopters (D), is the reciprocal of the focal length in meters. For a relaxed eye:\n\\[P = \\frac{1}{f} = \\frac{1}{0.022 \\text{ m}} \\approx 45.45 \\text{ D}\\]\nDuring accommodation, this can increase to about 52 D.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Illustration of the eye’s focal distances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe resolution of the eye is limited by diffraction and the spacing of photoreceptors. The minimum angle of resolution θ_min can be approximated by:\n\\[\\theta_{\\text{min}} \\approx \\frac{1.22\\lambda}{D}\\]\nwhere λ is the wavelength of light and D is the diameter of the pupil. For a 3 mm pupil and 555 nm light (peak sensitivity), this gives a theoretical resolution of about 1 arc minute.\n\n\n\nThe human eye, under normal conditions, focuses images of distant objects onto the retina at the back focal distance of approximately 22 mm. However, various refractive errors can occur due to imperfections in the eye’s optical system, primarily the cornea and lens. These errors affect the eye’s ability to focus light accurately on the retina, leading to vision problems.\nCommon refractive errors include:\n\nMyopia (Short-sightedness): Light from distant objects focuses in front of the retina, causing distant objects to appear blurry while near objects remain clear.\nHyperopia (Far-sightedness): Light focuses behind the retina, making nearby objects appear blurry while distant objects may remain clear.\nAstigmatism: The cornea or lens isn’t perfectly spherical, causing light to focus at multiple points rather than a single sharp point on the retina.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Correction of Myopia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Correction of Hyperopia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Left: Myopia correction using a concave lens. Right: Hyperopia correction using a convex lens.\n\n\n\nThe severity of refractive errors can be quantified using the concept of refractive power. The refractive error R of the eye, measured in diopters (D), is calculated as:\n\\[R = \\frac{1}{f_{\\text{required}}} - \\frac{1}{f_{\\text{actual}}}\\]\nwhere f_required is the focal length needed for perfect focus, and f_actual is the eye’s actual focal length. This formula helps determine the degree of correction needed for various eye defects.\nIn a normal, relaxed state, the human eye can observe objects clearly up to a distance of approximately \\(s_0=25\\) cm without additional accommodation of the lens. This distance, known as the range of clear visual sight, varies among individuals and is used as a standard in optical calculations. Objects within this range can be observed under a visual angle \\(\\epsilon_0\\). For small angles, which is typically the case in vision, the angular size \\(\\epsilon_0\\) of an object of height h at a distance \\(s_0\\) is approximated by:\n\\[\n\\epsilon_0 \\approx \\tan(\\epsilon_0) = \\frac{h}{s_0}\n\\]\nThis relationship is fundamental in understanding how objects are perceived and in designing corrective lenses and optical instruments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Diagram of a relaxed eye focusing on a distant object.\n\n\n\nhistory |grep git\nUnderstanding these concepts is crucial for diagnosing vision problems and designing appropriate corrective measures, whether through eyeglasses, contact lenses, or surgical interventions.\n\n\n\nHaving discussed the basic structure and function of the human eye, we now turn to how optical instruments can enhance our vision. Instead of calculating the magnification of optical instruments from object and image distances, we introduce a more relevant measure: the angular magnification.\nThe angular magnification, V, is defined as the ratio of the angle subtended by the image when viewed through the instrument to the angle subtended by the object when viewed with the naked eye at the near point. It is given by:\n\\[\nV=\\frac{\\tan(\\epsilon)}{\\tan(\\epsilon_0)}\\approx \\frac{\\epsilon}{\\epsilon_0}\n\\]\nwhere: - ε is the angle subtended by the image at the eye when viewed through the instrument - ε₀ is the angle subtended by the object when viewed with the naked eye at the near point\nThis concept is crucial in understanding how optical instruments like telescopes and microscopes enhance our vision. Angular magnification effectively increases the apparent size of objects by increasing the angle at which they are viewed. This measure is particularly useful as the actual image size is often not directly accessible or relevant to the viewer’s experience.",

For small angles, which is typically the case in vision, the angular size \\(\\epsilon_0\\) of an object of height h at a distance \\(s_0\\) is approximated by:\n\\[\n\\epsilon_0 \\approx \\tan(\\epsilon_0) = \\frac{h}{s_0}\n\\]\nThis relationship is fundamental in understanding how objects are perceived and in designing corrective lenses and optical instruments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Diagram of a relaxed eye focusing on a distant object.\n\n\n\nhistory |grep git\nUnderstanding these concepts is crucial for diagnosing vision problems and designing appropriate corrective measures, whether through eyeglasses, contact lenses, or surgical interventions.\n\n\n\nHaving discussed the basic structure and function of the human eye, we now turn to how optical instruments can enhance our vision. Instead of calculating the magnification of optical instruments from object and image distances, we introduce a more relevant measure: the angular magnification.\nThe angular magnification, V, is defined as the ratio of the angle subtended by the image when viewed through the instrument to the angle subtended by the object when viewed with the naked eye at the near point. It is given by:\n\\[\nV=\\frac{\\tan(\\epsilon)}{\\tan(\\epsilon_0)}\\approx \\frac{\\epsilon}{\\epsilon_0}\n\\]\nwhere: - ε is the angle subtended by the image at the eye when viewed through the instrument - ε₀ is the angle subtended by the object when viewed with the naked eye at the near point\nThis concept is crucial in understanding how optical instruments like telescopes and microscopes enhance our vision. Angular magnification effectively increases the apparent size of objects by increasing the angle at which they are viewed. This measure is particularly useful as the actual image size is often not directly accessible or relevant to the viewer’s experience.",

    "title": "Proof that a Mirror Must Have a Parabolic Shape",
    "section": "",
    "text": "We would like to show in the following, that a parabolic mirror is a shape which reflects all light rays parallel to the principal axis to a single point, the focus. This is a fundamental property of parabolic mirrors and is used in many optical systems, such as telescopes, satellite dishes, and car headlights.\nFor this purpose, we would like to use Fermat’s principle. We examine a light ray originating from a point \\(x,y_0\\) and travelling parallel to the principal axis. The light ray is reflected at a point \\((x,y)\\) on the mirror and travels to the focus at \\((0,p)\\). The light path is therefore consisting out of two linear segments \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) for which we have to calculate the time of travel. The total duration of the light’s journey is then: \\[\nt = t_A + t_B\n\\]\nwhere:\n\n\\(t_A\\) is the time taken to travel from \\(x,y_0\\) to the mirror.\n\\(t_B\\) is the time taken to travel from \\((x,y)\\) to \\((0,p)\\).\n\n\nTime for Path A\nThe distance covered in path A is equal to \\(y_0 - y\\), where \\(y\\) represents the y-coordinate of the point where the ray meets the mirror. Consequently, the time taken for the light to traverse path A can be expressed as:\n\\[\nt_A = \\frac{y_0 - y}{c}\n\\]\nIn this equation, \\(c\\) represents the speed of light in the medium.\n\n\nTime for Path B\nAfter reflection, the light ray travels from the point \\((x, y)\\) on the mirror’s surface to the focal point located at \\((0, p)\\). The length of this segment of the path can be calculated using the distance formula:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{x^2 + (y - p)^2}\n\\]\nConsequently, the time required for the light to traverse path B is expressed as:\n\\[\nt_B = \\frac{\\sqrt{x^2 + (y - p)^2}}{c}\n\\]\n\n\nTotal Time\nThe total time for the light ray’s journey is the sum of times for paths A and B:\n\\[\nt = \\frac{y_0 - y}{v} + \\frac{\\sqrt{x^2 + (y - p)^2}}{c}\n\\]\nAccording to Fermat’s principle, all light rays should take the same time. We can express this by setting the total time equal to a constant \\(t_c\\):\n\\[\n\\frac{y_0 - y}{v} + \\frac{\\sqrt{x^2 + (y - p)^2}}{v} = t_c\n\\]\nFor a ray traveling along the y-axis, reflecting at \\((0, 0)\\), the total distance is \\(y_0 + p\\). The time for this ray is:\n\\[\n\\frac{y_0 + p}{c}\n\\]\nThis gives us \\(t_c = \\frac{y_0 + p}{c}\\). Substituting into our general equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{y_0 - y}{v} + \\frac{\\sqrt{x^2 + (y - p)^2}}{c} = \\frac{y_0 + p}{c}\n\\]\nMultiplying by \\(c\\) and rearranging:\n\\[\ny_0 - y + \\sqrt{x^2 + (y - p)^2} = y_0 + p\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sqrt{x^2 + (y - p)^2} = y + p\n\\]\nSquaring both sides and simplifying:\n\\[\nx^2 + (y - p)^2 = (y + p)^2\n\\]\n\\[\nx^2 + y^2 - 2py + p^2 = y^2 + 2py + p^2\n\\]\n\\[\nx^2 = 4py\n\\]\nor\n\\[\ny=\\frac{1}{4p}x^2\n\\]\nThis final equation describes a parabola with its focus at \\((0, p)\\).\nMatrix Representation For a thin lens of focal length f, the matrix is:\n\\[M_{thin} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -1/f & 1 \\end{bmatrix}\\]\nEquivalent Thin Lens: We want our thick lens matrix to be equivalent to a thin lens sandwiched between two translations:\n\\[\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -H' \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}\n   \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -1/f & 1 \\end{bmatrix}\n   \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & H \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}\n   = \\begin{bmatrix} A & B \\\\ C & D \\end{bmatrix}\\]"
