# Wave Equation

The general form of the wave equation is:

$$
\nabla^2 \Psi - \frac{1}{v^2} \frac{\partial^2 \Psi}{\partial t^2} = 0
$$

## Plane Waves {#plane-waves}

Plane waves are solutions to the wave equation where the wavefronts are infinite planes.

## Spherical Waves {#spherical-waves}

Spherical waves emanate from a point source and have wavefronts that are spheres.
