The Fabry-Perot interferometer demonstrates multiple-wave interference with decreasing amplitude. It consists of two parallel mirrors separated by a distance $d$, creating multiple reflections of incident light.

![Simplified Sketch of a Fabry-Perot Interferometer.](img/fabry_perot.png){width=70% fig-align="center"}

When light with amplitude $A_0$ enters the interferometer, it undergoes a series of transmissions and reflections. The first transmitted wave has amplitude:

$$
U_1=A_0t_1 t_2
$$

where $t_1$ and $t_2$ are the transmission coefficients of the first and second mirrors. The second transmitted wave includes reflections from both mirrors ($r_1$ and $r_2$) and a phase shift $\Delta\phi$:

$$
U_2=A_0t_1 t_2 r_1 r_2 e^{i\phi}=U_1 r_1 r_2 e^{i\Delta\phi}
$$

This follows our earlier treatment of multiple-wave interference with decreasing amplitude, where $\sqrt{I_0}=A_0 t_1 t_2$ and $r=r_1r_2$. The phase shift between successive reflections is:

$$
\phi=\frac{2\pi}{\lambda} \Delta s = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda} 2d\cos(\theta)
$$

where $\Delta s=2d\cos(\theta)$ represents the path difference between adjacent rays.

The resulting intensity distribution is:

$$
I=|U|^2=\frac{I_{0}}{|1-re^{i\phi}|^2}=\frac{I_0}{(1-r)^2+4r\sin^2\left (\frac{2\pi}{\lambda} d\cos(\theta)\right)}
$$

### Finesse and Spectral Properties

The quality of interference in a Fabry-Perot interferometer is characterized by the Finesse $\mathcal{F}$:

$$
\mathcal{F}=\frac{\pi \sqrt{r}}{1-r}
$$

where $r=r_1r_2$ is the product of the mirrors' reflection coefficients. As $r$ approaches 1 (higher reflectivity), the Finesse increases, resulting in sharper interference peaks.

For normal incidence ($\theta=0$), the phase difference simplifies to:

$$
\Delta\phi=\frac{4\pi d}{\lambda}
$$

Constructive interference occurs when $\Delta\phi=m2\pi$ (where $m$ is an integer), giving us the wavelengths of transmission maxima:

$$
\lambda_m=\frac{2d}{m}
$$

#### Free Spectral Range

The spacing between adjacent transmission peaks in an optical system can be expressed in terms of either wavelength or frequency. This spacing is known as the **free spectral range (FSR)**.

**In Wavelength:**

   The difference in wavelength between adjacent transmission peaks is given by:

   $$
   \delta \lambda = \lambda_{m} - \lambda_{m+1} = \frac{\lambda_m}{m+1}
   $$

   Here, $\lambda_m$ is the wavelength corresponding to the $m$-th transmission peak.

**In Frequency:**

   The difference in frequency between adjacent transmission peaks is given by:

   $$
   \delta \nu = \nu_{m+1} - \nu_m = \frac{c}{2d}
   $$

   Here, $c$ is the speed of light, and $d$ is the distance between the reflecting surfaces in the optical system.

The free spectral range (FSR) represents the interval between successive transmission peaks and is a crucial parameter in the design and analysis of optical systems, such as Fabry-Pérot interferometers and optical resonators.

#### Spectral Resolution

The spectral resolution of an interferometer is determined by the width of its interference peaks, which indicates the instrument's ability to distinguish between closely spaced wavelengths. This width is often characterized by the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the peaks.

To find the FWHM, we start with the intensity ratio at half maximum:

$$
\frac{I}{I_{\rm max}} = \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{1 + \left( \frac{\mathcal{F}}{\pi} \right)^2 \Delta \phi_{1/2}^2 }
$$

Solving for the phase difference $\Delta \phi_{1/2}$ at half maximum, we can determine the corresponding frequency width:

$$
\Delta \nu = \frac{c}{2d \mathcal{F}} = \frac{\delta \nu}{\mathcal{F}}
$$

Here, $\delta \nu$ is the free spectral range, $c$ is the speed of light, $d$ is the distance between the reflecting surfaces, and $\mathcal{F}$ is the finesse of the interferometer.

The finesse $\mathcal{F}$ is defined as the ratio of the free spectral range to the FWHM:

$$
\mathcal{F} = \frac{\delta \nu}{\Delta \nu} = \frac{\lambda}{\Delta \lambda}
$$

This ratio provides a measure of the interferometer's spectral resolution, indicating how well it can separate two closely spaced spectral lines.

The overall resolving power $\mathcal{R}$ of the interferometer is given by:

$$
\mathcal{R} = m \mathcal{F}
$$

where $m$ is the order of the interference. The resolving power $\mathcal{R}$ quantifies the ability of the interferometer to resolve spectral features, with higher values indicating better resolution.

## Free Spectral Range and Spectral Resolution

**Free Spectral Range (FSR):**

The free spectral range is the spacing between adjacent transmission maxima in a Fabry-Perot interferometer. It can be expressed in terms of wavelength or frequency:

- In wavelength:
  $$
  \delta \lambda = \lambda_{m} - \lambda_{m+1} = \frac{\lambda_m}{m+1}
  $$

- In frequency:
  $$
  \delta \nu = \nu_{m+1} - \nu_m = \frac{c}{2d}
  $$

The FSR indicates the range over which the interferometer can distinguish between different wavelengths or frequencies before the next order of interference occurs.

**Spectral Resolution:**

The spectral resolution of a Fabry-Perot interferometer is determined by the width of the interference peaks. It is often quantified by the Finesse ($\mathcal{F}$), which is the ratio of the free spectral range to the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the peaks:

$$
\mathcal{F} = \frac{\delta \nu}{\Delta \nu} = \frac{\lambda}{\Delta \lambda}
$$

The resolving power ($\mathcal{R}$) of the interferometer is given by:

$$
\mathcal{R} = m \mathcal{F}
$$

where $m$ is the interference order. The resolving power indicates the ability of the interferometer to distinguish between closely spaced spectral lines.

### Ring Pattern Formation

When a Fabry-Perot interferometer is used with an extended monochromatic light source and appropriate optics, it produces a characteristic ring pattern:

![Fabry Perot Interferometer and interference pattern observed in the lecture.](img/fabry_w_lens.png){width=90% fig-align="center"}

The rings represent contours of constant phase difference, becoming more closely spaced with increasing radius as demonstrated in these experimental observations:
