# Welcome to the Experimental Physics 3 Course!

In this Experimental Physics 3 course, we will explore fundamental experiments and mathematical descriptions related to light propagation, electromagnetic waves, and their material counterpart, matter waves. Specifically, we will focus on:

- Geometrical Optics
- Wave Optics
- Electromagnetic Waves
- Matter Waves and Quantum Mechanics

The fields of optics and quantum mechanics are currently vibrant areas of research, with rapidly evolving optical technologies, high-resolution microscopy, and quantum information science. All of these advancements build upon the foundations that we will address in this course.
