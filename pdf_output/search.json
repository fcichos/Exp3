    "text": "Historical Context of Reflection Laws\n\n\n\n\n\nThe study of reflection has a rich history dating back to ancient times:\n\nAncient Greece (300 BCE): Euclid, in his work “Catoptrics,” was among the first to formally describe the law of reflection. He stated that the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection.\nAncient Rome (50 CE): Hero of Alexandria expanded on Euclid’s work, applying the principle that light travels along the path of least distance.\nIslamic Golden Age (1000 CE): Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) made significant contributions to optics in his “Book of Optics.” He conducted experiments to verify the law of reflection and explored the properties of spherical and parabolic mirrors.\n17th Century: Fermat’s Principle, formulated by Pierre de Fermat, provided a more general framework for understanding reflection (and refraction) based on the principle of least time.\nModern Era: The understanding of reflection has been further refined with the development of electromagnetic theory by James Clerk Maxwell in the 19th century and quantum optics in the 20th century.\n\n\n\n\nThe law of reflection is probably the most simple one. Yet the simplicity gives us the chance to define some basic objects which we will further use for the description of light rays and their propagation.\n\n3.0.1 Law of Reflection\nThe sketch below shows the reflection of an incoming light ray (red) on an interface. This incoming light ray has an angle \\(\\theta_{1}\\) with the axis (dashed line), which is perpendicular to the reflecting surface. As compared to X-ray diffraction, we measure the angle to the normal of the surface and not to the surface itself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Law of reflection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Experimental Demonstration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1— Figure 3.1 (a) illustrates the law of reflection, while Figure Figure 3.1 (b) shows an experimental demonstration.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1 (a) shows the reflection of an incoming light ray (red) on an interface. This incoming light ray has an angle \\(\\theta_{1}\\) with the axis (dashed line), which is perpendicular to the reflecting surface. As compared to X-ray diffraction, we measure the angle to the normal of the surface and not to the surface itself.\nThe law of reflection tells us now, that the outgoing reflected ray is now leaving the surface under an angle \\(\\theta_2=\\theta_1\\). So both angles are the same for the reflection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaw of Reflection\n\n\n\nIf a ray is incident to a reflecting surface under an angle \\(\\theta_1\\) it will be reflected towards under an angle \\(\\theta_2=\\theta_1\\) to the same side of the surface.\n\n\n\n\n3.0.2 Fermat’s Principle\nThe law of reflection can be actually obtained from a variational principle saying the light rays propagate along those path on which the propagation time is an extremum. This variational principle is called Fermat’s principle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2— Sketch for deriving the law of reflection from Fermat’s principle\n\n\n\nConsider now a light ray that should travel from point \\(A\\) to point \\(C\\) via a point \\(B\\) on the mirror surface. In general multiple paths are possible such as the one indicated in the above picture. Clearly this path is not satisfying our reflection law formulated above. Fermat’s principle now restricts the path length from \\(A\\) to \\(C\\) to be the one, which takes the least amount of time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFermat’s principle\n\n\n\nThe path taken by a ray between two given points A, B is the path that can be traversed in the least time.\nMore precise alternative: A ray going in a certain particular path has the property that if we make a small change in the ray in any manner whatever, say in the location at which it comes to the mirror, or the shape of the curve, or anything, there will be no first-order change in the time; there will be only a second-order change in the time.\n\n\nSo let us consider that contraints to the path length. The total length the light hast to travel via the three points is\n\\[\nl=l_{1}+l_{2}=\\sqrt{(x-x_1)^2+y_1^2}+\\sqrt{(x_2-x)^2+y_2^2}\n\\]\nThe time that is required by the light to travel that distance \\(l\\) is then given by\n\\[\nt=\\frac{l}{c},\n\\]\nwhere \\(c\\) is the speed of light in the medium above the mirror. If this time should now be a minimum, we have to take the derivative of the time \\(t\\) with respect to the position \\(x\\) on the mirror and set that to zero, i.e.,\n\\[\\frac{\\mathrm dt}{\\mathrm dx}=0. \\tag{3.1}\\]\nThis results in Eq. 3.1\n\\[\n\\frac{x-x_1}{\\sqrt{(x-x_1)^2+y_{1}^2}}=\\frac{x_2-x}{\\sqrt{(x_2-x)^2+y_{2}^2}},\n\\]\nwhich is actually\n\\[\n\\frac{x-x_1}{l_1}=\\frac{x_2-x}{l_2}\n\\]\nor\n\\[\n\\sin(\\theta_1)=\\sin(\\theta_2)\n\\]\nwhich finally requires\n\\[\n\\theta_1=\\theta_2\n\\]\nand is our law of reflection. Thus, reflection satisfies Fermat’s principle, i.e. the light rays propagate along those path on which the propagation time is an extremum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrinciple of Least Action (Hamilton’s Principle)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Principle of Least Action, also known as Hamilton’s Principle, is a fundamental concept in classical mechanics. It states that the path taken by a physical system between two states is the one for which the action integral is stationary (usually a minimum).\n\n3.0.3 Action Integral\nThe action \\(S\\) is defined as the integral of the Lagrangian \\(L\\) over time:\n\\[\nS = \\int_{t_1}^{t_2} L \\, dt\n\\]\n\n\n3.0.4 Lagrangian\nThe Lagrangian \\(L\\) is a function that summarizes the dynamics of the system. For a system with generalized coordinates \\(q_i\\) and velocities \\(\\dot{q}_i\\), the Lagrangian is typically given by:\n\\[\nL = T - V\n\\]\nwhere:\n\n\\(T\\) is the kinetic energy of the system.\n\\(V\\) is the potential energy of the system.\n\n\n\n3.0.5 Euler-Lagrange Equations\nHamilton’s Principle leads to the Euler-Lagrange equations, which are the equations of motion for the system. These equations are derived by requiring that the action \\(S\\) be stationary with respect to variations in the path \\(q_i(t)\\):\n\\[\n\\delta S = 0\n\\]\nThis condition leads to the following differential equations:\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\left( \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{q}_i} \\right) - \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial q_i} = 0\n\\]\nThese are the Euler-Lagrange equations, and they provide a powerful method for deriving the equations of motion for a wide variety of physical systems.\n\n\n3.0.6 Example: Simple Harmonic Oscillator\nFor a simple harmonic oscillator with mass \\(m\\) and spring constant \\(k\\), the Lagrangian is:\n\\[\nL = \\frac{1}{2} m \\dot{x}^2 - \\frac{1}{2} k x^2\n\\]\nApplying the Euler-Lagrange equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\left( \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{x}} \\right) - \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x} = 0\n\\]\nwe get:\n\\[\nm \\ddot{x} + k x = 0\n\\]\nwhich is the familiar equation of motion for a simple harmonic oscillator.\nHamilton’s Principle and the associated Euler-Lagrange equations are foundational in classical mechanics and have far-reaching implications in other areas of physics, including quantum mechanics and field theory.",

    "text": "Historical Context of Refraction\n\n\n\n\n\nThe understanding of refraction has evolved over centuries, with contributions from various cultures and scientific traditions. This timeline highlights key milestones in the discovery and formalization of refraction, showcasing how our comprehension of this fundamental optical phenomenon has deepened over time:\n\nAncient Greece (3rd century BCE): Euclid noticed that a stick partially submerged in water appears bent. Archimedes studied the refraction of light in water.\nAncient Rome (1st century CE): Ptolemy conducted experiments on refraction and compiled tables of refraction angles for different media.\nIslamic Golden Age (10th-11th centuries): Ibn Sahl (940-1000) discovered the law of refraction, describing it geometrically. Alhazen (965-1040) studied lenses and the human eye, contributing significantly to optics.\nMiddle Ages: Robert Grosseteste (1175-1253) and Roger Bacon (1214-1294) studied refraction and its application to lenses.\nRenaissance: Thomas Harriot (1560-1621) rediscovered the law of refraction but didn’t publish his findings.\n17th Century: Willebrord Snellius (1580-1626) derived the mathematical law of refraction (Snell’s law) around 1621. René Descartes (1596-1650) independently derived and published the law of refraction in 1637. Pierre de Fermat (1607-1665) derived the law of refraction using his principle of least time.\n19th Century: Augustin-Jean Fresnel (1788-1827) developed the wave theory of light, explaining refraction in terms of changes in wave speed.\n20th Century: The quantum mechanical understanding of light, which emerged in the early 20th century, significantly impacted our view of refraction. Max Planck’s work on black body radiation in 1900 and Albert Einstein’s explanation of the photoelectric effect in 1905 laid the groundwork for the quantum nature of light. This quantum perspective provided a complementary explanation to the wave theory, describing refraction in terms of photons interacting with the atoms in the medium. While this quantum view offers insights into certain aspects of refraction, it’s important to note that both the wave and particle descriptions of light are necessary for a complete understanding of optical phenomena.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1 Refractive Index\nThe refractive index \\(n\\) is a material constant representing the factor by which the speed of light is reduced in the medium compared to its speed in vacuum. For most natural materials and visible light, the refractive index is \\(n \\ge 1\\), as light typically travels slower in media than in vacuum. However, in certain special cases—such as for X-rays in some materials or in engineered metamaterials—the refractive index can be less than 1 or even negative. Understanding these exotic cases requires a deeper exploration of the electromagnetic properties of materials and the origin of the refractive index, which we will address later.\n\n\n1.2 Snells Law\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaw of Refraction (Snell’s Law)\n\n\n\nThe law of refraction (Snell’s law) is given for the above sketch by the equation:\n\\[\nn_1 \\sin(\\theta_1)=n_2 \\sin(\\theta_2)\n\\]\n\n\nYou can explore the law of refraction using the interactive visualization below. The visualization shows a light ray incident on an interface between two media with different refractive indices. You can adjust the angle of incidence and the refractive index of the first medium to see how the angle of refraction changes according to Snell’s law.\n\n\n\nIncident Angle: 45°\n\nRefractive Index n₁: 1.0\n\nRefractive Index n₂: 1.5\n\n\n\n\nSnell’s law leads to some general patterns in the behavior of light rays at interfaces, which are worth remembering. Consider these two cases:\n\nWhen light moves from a medium with lower refractive index to one with higher refractive index (\\(n_1 &lt; n_2\\)):\n\nThe refracted ray bends towards the normal (optical axis)\nThe angle of refraction is smaller than the angle of incidence (\\(\\theta_2 &lt; \\theta_1\\))\n\nWhen light moves from a medium with higher refractive index to one with lower refractive index (\\(n_1 &gt; n_2\\)):\n\nThe refracted ray bends away from the normal (optical axis)\nThe angle of refraction is larger than the angle of incidence (\\(\\theta_2 &gt; \\theta_1\\))\n\n\nFigure 4.1 illustrates these principles with three plots showing how the refracted angle changes with the incident angle for two common interface scenarios: glass-to-air and air-to-glass. These plots clearly demonstrate the different behaviors described above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1— Snell’s law for different combinations of refractive indices. The plots show the relationship between incident angle (\\(\\theta_1\\)) and refracted angle (\\(\\theta_2\\)) for three scenarios: (a) light passing from air to glass, (b) light passing from glass to air, and (c) a comparison of both cases. Note how the curves differ when light moves into a medium with higher refractive index versus a lower refractive index.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3 Total Internal Reflection\nThe above diagram reveals a special case occurring when \\(n_1 &gt; n_2\\). Under these conditions, we can increase the incident angle \\(\\theta_1\\) until the outgoing angle reaches \\(\\theta_2 = \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\). At this point, the refracted ray would be traveling along the interface between the two media. For any incident angle \\(\\theta_1\\) larger than this critical angle, there is no refracted ray at all; instead, we observe only a reflected ray. This phenomenon, known as total internal reflection, occurs despite the fact that the material with refractive index \\(n_2\\) is completely transparent.\nLet’s formalize this concept mathematically. Using Snell’s law and setting \\(\\theta_2 = \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\), we obtain the equation for the critical angle \\(\\theta_c\\):\n\\[\\theta_1 = \\theta_c = \\sin^{-1}\\left(\\frac{n_2}{n_1}\\right)\\]\nNote that the \\(\\sin^{-1}()\\) function requires an argument \\(\\le 1\\), which is why this phenomenon only occurs when \\(n_2 &lt; n_1\\).\nIt’s important to understand that during total internal reflection, all of the light energy is reflected back into the first medium, hence the term ‘total’. However, electromagnetic optics reveals an interesting subtlety: an evanescent wave penetrates a short distance into the second medium, though it doesn’t propagate energy across the boundary.\nWhen the incident angle exceeds the critical angle, Snell’s law as we’ve written it no longer applies. Instead, we observe perfect reflection, where the angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence, just as in regular reflection from a mirror. This reflection occurs without any loss of energy to the second medium, making it an extremely efficient process.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Internal Reflection\n\n\n\nTotal internal reflection occurs when light is passing from higher refractive index to lower refractive index materials for incidence angle larger than a critical angle\n\\[\n\\theta_c=\\sin^{-1}\\left (\\frac{n_2}{n_1}\\right )\n\\]\n\n\nWe can demonstrate total internal reflection very easily with a water basin, for example, where we couple in light from a laser from the side.\n \nBut you could try that yourself also in the bath tub diving below the water surface.\nTotal internal reflection has numerous practical applications:\n\nFiber optic communications: Light signals can travel long distances with minimal loss through optical fibers.\nOptical instruments: Prisms in binoculars and telescopes use total internal reflection to manipulate light paths.\nGemstones: The sparkle of diamonds is enhanced by total internal reflection trapping light within the stone.\nMedical endoscopes: Total internal reflection helps guide light through flexible tubes for internal imaging.\n\nOptical Fibers and Total Internal Reflection\nTotal internal reflection plays a crucial role in modern telecommunications, particularly in optical fibers, which are also part of many experimental setups. These fibers are essentially ultra-thin glass wires, ranging in diameter from a few micrometers to several hundred micrometers, designed to transport light over long distances with minimal loss.\nThe structure of an optical fiber is key to its function:\n\nCore: A central glass core with a refractive index \\(n_1\\)\nCladding: A surrounding layer with a slightly lower refractive index \\(n_2\\)\n\nThis difference in refractive indices is what allows total internal reflection to occur within the fiber.\n \nFor light to propagate effectively through the fiber, it must enter at an angle that ensures total internal reflection at the core-cladding interface. This leads to the concept of the acceptance angle, \\(\\theta_a\\), which is the maximum angle at which light can enter the fiber and still undergo total internal reflection.\nTo characterize this acceptance angle, optical engineers use a parameter called the Numerical Aperture (NA).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumerical Aperture\n\n\n\nThe Numerical Aperture of a fiber is defined as the sine of the maximum acceptance angle:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nNA = \\sin(\\theta_a) = \\sqrt{n_1^2 - n_2^2}\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\n\nThis equation relates the NA directly to the refractive indices of the core and cladding. The derivation of this formula involves applying Snell’s law at the air-fiber interface and at the core-cladding interface, then using the condition for total internal reflection.\nIn practice, typical values for the refractive indices might be \\(n_1 = 1.475\\) for the core and \\(n_2 = 1.46\\) for the cladding. Plugging these into our equation:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nNA = \\sqrt{1.475^2 - 1.46^2} \\approx 0.2\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThis means that light entering the fiber within a cone of about 11.5° (arcsin(0.2)) from the fiber’s axis will be transmitted through the fiber via total internal reflection.\nThe NA is an important parameter in fiber optic design:\n\nIt determines the light-gathering ability of the fiber.\nIt affects the fiber’s bandwidth and its susceptibility to certain types of signal distortion.\nIt influences how easily the fiber can be coupled to light sources and other fibers.\n\nOptical fibers come in various types, each optimized for different applications. Some fibers are designed to transmit light over long distances with minimal loss, while others are engineered for specific wavelengths or to guide light in unusual ways. The figure below shows a few examples of optical fiber types.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2— Rendering of different optical fibers types (from left to right): Hollow core optical fiber, hollow core bragg fiber, photonic crystal fiber, conventional fiber\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4 Fermat’s Principle for Inhomogeneous Media\nWhile before we have considered Fermat’s principle for the special case of refraction and light propagation in a homogeneous medium, we can define a more general version of it correponding to the following situation also involving an inhomogeneous refractive index \\(n(\\vec{r})\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3— Sketch for a general description of Fermat’s principle\n\n\n\nFor this general scenario of light traveling along a path, we can define an optical path length (OPL) as\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\text{OPL} = \\int\\limits_{A}^{C} n(\\mathbf{r}) \\mathrm ds=0,\n\\end{equation}\\]\nwith a varying refractive index \\(n(\\mathbf{r})\\). Fermat’s Principle states that the actual path taken by the light makes the OPL stationary:\n\\[\n\\delta \\left( \\int_A^B n(\\mathbf{r}) \\, ds \\right) = 0\n\\]\nUsing the calculus of variations, this leads to the Euler-Lagrange equation for the path of light. In Cartesian coordinates, if the path is parameterized by \\(\\mathbf{r}(s) = (x(s), y(s), z(s))\\), the Euler-Lagrange equations become:\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{ds} \\left( n \\frac{d\\mathbf{r}}{ds} \\right) = \\nabla n\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\nabla n\\) is the gradient of the refractive index. This equation describes how the light ray bends in response to changes in the refractive index of the medium.\nFermat’s Principle is a cornerstone of geometrical optics and has applications in designing optical systems, understanding mirages, and analyzing the behavior of light in various media.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFermat’s Principle and Snells Law\n\n\n\n\n\nWe would like to apply Fermat’s principle to derive Snell’s law, which is a more lengthy calculation. To do this, we consider a light ray traveling from point \\(A\\) in medium 1 (with refractive index \\(n_1\\)) to point \\(C\\) in medium 2 (with refractive index \\(n_2\\)), crossing the interface at point \\(B\\). Let the coordinates of points \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) be \\((x_A, y_A)\\), \\((x_B, y_B)\\), and \\((x_C, y_C)\\), respectively. Assume the interface between the two media is at \\(y = y_B\\). The optical path length (OPL) is given by:\n\\[\n\\delta \\int_{A}^{C} n(\\vec{r}) \\, ds = 0,\n\\]\nwhere \\(n(\\vec{r})\\) is the refractive index at position \\(\\vec{r}\\), and \\(ds\\) is an infinitesimal element of the path.\nConsider a light ray traveling from point \\(A\\) in medium 1 (with refractive index \\(n_1\\)) to point \\(C\\) in medium 2 (with refractive index \\(n_2\\)), crossing the interface at point \\(B\\). Let the coordinates of points \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) be \\((x_A, y_A)\\), \\((x_B, y_B)\\), and \\((x_C, y_C)\\), respectively. Assume the interface between the two media is at \\(y = y_B\\).\n\n1.4.1 Optical Path Length\nThe optical path length (OPL) is given by:\n\\[\n\\text{OPL} = n_1 \\int_{A}^{B} ds_1 + n_2 \\int_{B}^{C} ds_2,\n\\]\nwhere \\(ds_1\\) and \\(ds_2\\) are the infinitesimal path lengths in media 1 and 2, respectively.\n\n\n1.4.2 Path Lengths\nThe path lengths \\(ds_1\\) and \\(ds_2\\) can be expressed in terms of the coordinates:\n\\[\nds_1 = \\sqrt{(dx_1)^2 + (dy_1)^2}, \\quad ds_2 = \\sqrt{(dx_2)^2 + (dy_2)^2}.\n\\]\nSince the interface is at \\(y = y_B\\), we have \\(dy_1 = y_B - y_A\\) and \\(dy_2 = y_C - y_B\\). The total optical path length is:\n\\[\n\\text{OPL} = n_1 \\sqrt{(x_B - x_A)^2 + (y_B - y_A)^2} + n_2 \\sqrt{(x_C - x_B)^2 + (y_C - y_B)^2}.\n\\]\n\n\n1.4.3 Applying Fermat’s Principle\nTo find the stationary path, we take the variation of the OPL with respect to \\(x_B\\):\n\\[\n\\delta \\text{OPL} = \\delta \\left[ n_1 \\sqrt{(x_B - x_A)^2 + (y_B - y_A)^2} + n_2 \\sqrt{(x_C - x_B)^2 + (y_C - y_B)^2} \\right] = 0.\n\\]\nTaking the derivative with respect to \\(x_B\\):\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_B} \\left[ n_1 \\sqrt{(x_B - x_A)^2 + (y_B - y_A)^2} + n_2 \\sqrt{(x_C - x_B)^2 + (y_C - y_B)^2} \\right] = 0.\n\\]\n\n\n1.4.4 Differentiating\nDifferentiating each term separately:\n\\[\nn_1 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_B} \\sqrt{(x_B - x_A)^2 + (y_B - y_A)^2} + n_2 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_B} \\sqrt{(x_C - x_B)^2 + (y_C - y_B)^2} = 0.\n\\]\nUsing the chain rule:\n\\[\nn_1 \\frac{x_B - x_A}{\\sqrt{(x_B - x_A)^2 + (y_B - y_A)^2}} + n_2 \\frac{x_B - x_C}{\\sqrt{(x_C - x_B)^2 + (y_C - y_B)^2}} = 0.\n\\]\n\n\n1.4.5 Simplifying\nLet \\(\\theta_1\\) be the angle of incidence and \\(\\theta_2\\) be the angle of refraction. Then:\n\\[\n\\sin \\theta_1 = \\frac{x_B - x_A}{\\sqrt{(x_B - x_A)^2 + (y_B - y_A)^2}}, \\quad \\sin \\theta_2 = \\frac{x_C - x_B}{\\sqrt{(x_C - x_B)^2 + (y_C - y_B)^2}}.\n\\]\nSubstituting these into the equation:\n\\[\nn_1 \\sin \\theta_1 + n_2 \\sin \\theta_2 = 0.\n\\]\nSince \\(\\sin \\theta_2\\) is in the opposite direction, we have:\n\\[\nn_1 \\sin \\theta_1 = n_2 \\sin \\theta_2.\n\\]\nThis is Snell’s law, which describes the relationship between the angles of incidence and refraction when light passes from one medium to another.\n\n\n1.4.6 Conclusion\nBy applying Fermat’s principle and taking the variation of the optical path length, we have derived Snell’s law:\n\\[\nn_1 \\sin \\theta_1 = n_2 \\sin \\theta_2.\n\\]\nThis demonstrates how the principle of least time leads to the well-known law of refraction in optics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Light in a Graded-Index Medium\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider a medium where the refractive index varies with height \\(y\\) as \\(n(y) = n_0 (1 - \\frac{\\alpha^2}{2 n_0} y^2)\\). The path of light in such a medium can be found by using Fermat’s principle in differential form:\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{ds}\\left (n(\\textbf{r})\\frac{d\\textbf{r}}{ds}\\right)=\\nabla n(\\textbf{r})\n\\]\nTypically, this requires to express the coordinates in terms of a parameter, such as \\(x(s)\\) and \\(y(s)\\), and then solve the differential equation. The solution will give the path of light in the medium. This is difficult and commonly done numerically. In paraxial optics, when the light is propagating roughly in the direction of \\(z\\), the differential element \\(ds\\) can be approximated as \\(dz\\) since then\n\\[\nds=dz\\sqrt{1+\\left (\\frac{dy}{dz}\\right )^2+\\left (\\frac{dx}{dz}\\right)^2}\\approx dz\n\\]\nwhich yields\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{dz}\\left (n\\frac{dx}{dz}\\right)\\approx \\frac{dn}{dx}\n\\]\nand\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{dz}\\left (n\\frac{dy}{dz}\\right )\\approx \\frac{dn}{dy}\n\\]\nThis readily yields the path of light in a homogeneous medium, where \\(n\\) is constant. In this case we have\n\\[\n\\frac{d^2 x}{dz^2}=\\frac{d^2 y}{dz^2}=0\n\\]\nwhich is true for a straight line. In a graded-index medium, the path of light can be found by solving the differential equation\n\\[\n\\frac{d^2 y}{dz^2}=-\\alpha^2 y\n\\]\nwhich is reminiscent of the equation of motion of a harmonic oscillator. The solution is therefore an oscillating function\n\\[\ny(z)=y_0\\cos(\\alpha z)+\\frac{\\theta_0}{\\alpha}\\sin(\\alpha z  )\n\\]\nwhere the angle \\(\\theta_0\\) is the initial angle of the light ray with respect to the \\(z\\) axis. This solution describes the path of light in a graded-index medium.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFermats’s Principle in Integral and Differential Form\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have described Fermat’t principle in an integral form specifiying the optical path length \\(S\\) as\n\\[\nOPL=\\int n(\\textbf{r})ds\n\\]\nThe path length \\(ds\\) can be given in terms of two coordinates \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) parametrized by \\(\\lambda\\) such that\n\\[\nds=\\sqrt{\\dot{x}_1^{2}+\\dot{x}_2^{2}}d\\lambda\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\dot{x}_1=\\frac{dx_{1}}{d\\lambda}\\). We can therefore write Fermat’s principle as\n\\[\n\\delta OPL=\\int\\left[\\left(\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial x_i} \\delta x_i\\right) \\sqrt{\\dot{x}_1^2+\\dot{x}_2^2}+n \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\dot{x}_1^2+\\dot{x}_2^2}} \\dot{x}_i \\delta \\dot{x}_i\\right] d \\lambda = 0\n\\]\nTo evaluate this integral we would like to integrate by parts. We can write the integrand as \\[\nu = n \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\dot{x}_1^2+\\dot{x}_2^2}} \\dot{x}_i\n\\]\nand\n\\[\ndv = \\delta \\dot{x}_i d\\lambda\n\\]\nWe can now calculate \\(du\\) and \\(v\\) and obtain\n\\[\ndu = \\frac{d}{d\\lambda}\\left[n \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\dot{x}_1^2+\\dot{x}_2^2}} \\dot{x}_i\\right] d\\lambda\n\\]\nand\n\\[\nv = \\delta x_i\n\\]\nWith these expressions we can now apply the integration by parts formula \\(\\int u dv = uv - \\int v du\\), we get:\n\\[\n\\int n \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\dot{x}_1^2+\\dot{x}_2^2}} \\dot{x}_i \\delta \\dot{x}_i d\\lambda = \\left[n \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\dot{x}_1^2+\\dot{x}_2^2}} \\dot{x}_i \\delta x_i\\right]|_{\\lambda_1}^{\\lambda_2} - \\int \\delta x_i \\frac{d}{d\\lambda}\\left[n \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\dot{x}_1^2+\\dot{x}_2^2}} \\dot{x}_i\\right] d\\lambda\n\\]\nThis can be substituted back into the original equation to obtain\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\delta OPL &= \\int \\left[\\left(\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial x_i} \\delta x_i\\right) \\sqrt{\\dot{x}_1^2+\\dot{x}_2^2}\\right] d\\lambda \\\\\n&+ \\left[n \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\dot{x}_1^2+\\dot{x}_2^2}} \\dot{x}_i \\delta x_i\\right]|_{\\lambda_1}^{\\lambda_2} \\\\\n&- \\int \\delta x_i \\frac{d}{d\\lambda}\\left[n \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\dot{x}_1^2+\\dot{x}_2^2}} \\dot{x}_i\\right] d\\lambda = 0\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nAfter rearranging the terms we get\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\delta OPL &= \\int \\left\\{\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial x_i} \\sqrt{\\dot{x}_1^2+\\dot{x}_2^2} - \\frac{d}{d\\lambda}\\left[n \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\dot{x}_1^2+\\dot{x}_2^2}} \\dot{x}_i\\right]\\right\\} \\delta x_i d\\lambda \\\\\n&+ \\left[n \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\dot{x}_1^2+\\dot{x}_2^2}} \\dot{x}_i \\delta x_i\\right]|_{\\lambda_1}^{\\lambda_2} = 0\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nand therefore finally\n\\[\n\\delta OPL=\\int\\left[\\left(\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial x_i}\\right) \\sqrt{\\dot{x}_1{ }^2+\\dot{x}_2{ }^2}-\\frac{d}{d \\lambda}\\left(n \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\dot{x}_1^2+\\dot{x}_2^2}} \\dot{x}_i\\right)\\right] \\delta x_i d \\lambda+\\text { boundary terms }\n\\]\nfor which we choose the parameter \\(\\lambda\\) such that the boundary terms vanish.\n\\[\n\\lambda=s\n\\]\nsuch that\n\\[\n\\sqrt{\\dot{x}_1^2+\\dot{x}_2^2}=1\n\\]\nand finally leads to the Euler-Lagrange equation\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial x_i}\\right)-\\frac{d}{d s}\\left(n \\dot{x}_i\\right)=0\n\\]\nwhich is the differential form of the Fermat’s principle.",

    "text": "5.1.1 Plane Mirrors\nWhen light radiates from a point \\(P\\) and reflects off a mirror, as shown in the image, the reflected rays diverge but appear to originate from a point \\(P'\\) located behind the mirror. According to the law of reflection, this image point is positioned at the same distance behind the mirror as the original object point is in front of it. As a result, an observer receiving these reflected rays, such as on their retina, perceives the point as if it were situated behind the mirror, even though no light actually travels behind the mirror surface.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1: Image formation on a plane mirror.\n\n\n\nWhen multiple points of an object emit light towards the mirror, this principle applies to each point. As a result, the entire object appears as an image behind the mirror. Since each point of the image is equidistant from the mirror as its corresponding object point, the image has the same size as the object. This leads to the definition of magnification as:\n\\[\nM=\\frac{h_{\\text{image}}}{h_{\\text{object}}}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.2: Image formation on a plane mirror.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirtual Images\n\n\n\nA virtual image is an optical illusion where light rays appear to come from a point, but don’t actually converge there. Unlike real images, virtual images can’t be projected onto a screen. They’re commonly seen in plane mirrors, convex mirrors, and when objects are closer to a lens than its focal point. Remember: for virtual images, light rays only seem to originate from the image when traced backwards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReal Images\n\n\n\nA real image forms when light rays actually meet at a point after reflection or refraction. These images can be projected onto a screen because light physically passes through the image location. Real images are often inverted and occur with concave mirrors and lenses when objects are beyond the focal point. Key point: real images involve actual convergence of light rays.\n\n\n\n\n5.1.2 Concave Mirrors\nFor a concave mirror (where the reflecting surface is on the inside of the spherical curve), applying the law of reflection yields interesting results. Light rays parallel to the optical axis, at a distance \\(h\\) from it, are reflected towards the axis and intersect it at a specific point \\(F\\). Due to the mirror’s symmetry, a parallel ray on the opposite side of the axis will also converge to this same point \\(F\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.3: Reflection of a parallel ray incident at a height \\(h\\) from the optical axis on a concave mirror.\n\n\n\nWe may calculate the position of the point \\(F\\), e.g. the distance from the mirror surface point \\(O\\), by applying the law of reflection. If the spherical mirror surface has a radius \\(R\\), then the distance between the center of the sphere \\(M\\) and the point \\(F\\) is given by\n\\[FM=\\frac{R}{2\\cos(\\alpha)}\\]\nTherefore, we can also calculate the distance of the mirror surface from the point \\(F\\), which results in\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nOF=R\\left (1-\\frac{1}{2\\cos(\\alpha)}\\right)=f\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThis distance is the so-called focal length of the concave mirror \\(f\\). For small angle \\(\\alpha\\), the above equation yields the so called paraxial limit (all angles are small and the rays are close to the optical axis). In this limit we find \\(\\cos(\\alpha)\\approx 1\\) and the focal length becomes \\(f=R/2\\). If we replace the cosine function by \\(\\cos(\\alpha)=\\sqrt{1-\\sin^2(\\alpha)}\\) with \\(\\sin(\\alpha)=h/R\\), we find\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nf=R\\left [ 1-\\frac{R}{2\\sqrt{R^2-h^2}}\\right ]\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThis equation is telling us, that the focal distance is not a single value for a concave mirror. The focal distance rather changes with the distance \\(h\\) from the optical axis. If \\(h\\) approaches \\(R\\) the focal length become shorter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFocal Length of a Concave Spherical Mirror\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.4: Spherical mirror of radius \\(R=4\\) reflecting parallel rays, showing spherical aberration and focal distance as a function of the distance from the optical axis \\(h\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo obtain now an equation which predicts the point at which the reflected ray intersects the optical axis if it emerged at a point \\(A\\), we just consider the following sketch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.5: Image formation on a concave mirror.\n\n\n\nFor this situation, we can write down immediately the following relations\n\\[\\delta=\\alpha+\\gamma\\]\n\\[\\gamma+\\beta=2\\delta\\]\nFurther under the assumption of small angles (paraxial approximation) we can write down\n\\[\\tan(\\gamma) \\approx \\gamma = \\frac{h}{g}\\] \\[\\tan(\\beta) \\approx \\beta = \\frac{h}{b}\\] \\[\\sin(\\delta) \\approx \\delta = \\frac{h}{R}\\]\nfrom which we obtain\n\\[\\frac{h}{g}+\\frac{h}{b}=2\\frac{h}{R}\\]\nand by divding by \\(h\\) finally the imaging equation:\n\\[\\frac{1}{g}+\\frac{1}{b}= \\frac{2}{R}= \\frac{1}{f}\\]\nwhere we have used the focal length \\(f=R/2\\). This equation has some surprising property. It is completely independent of \\(h\\) and \\(\\gamma\\). That means all points in a plane at a distance \\(g\\) are images into a plane at a distance \\(b\\). Both planes are therefore called conjugated planes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImaging Equation Concave Mirror\n\n\n\nThe sum of the inverse object and image distances equals the inverse focal length of the cocave mirror.\n\\[\\frac{1}{g}+\\frac{1}{b}\\approx\\frac{1}{f}\\]\n\n\nThis equation now helps to construct the image of an object in front of a concave mirror and we may define 3 different rays to identify the size of an image \\(h_{\\text{image}}\\) from the size of an object \\(h_{\\text{object}}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.6: Image formation on a concave mirror.\n\n\n\nIn the diagram above, three key rays are used to construct the image:\n\nRed ray: Parallel to optical axis → reflects through focal point\nGreen ray: Through focal point → reflects parallel to optical axis\nCentral ray: Through center of curvature → reflects back along same path\n\nThe behavior of these reflected rays determines the nature of the image:\n\nIf the rays intersect on the same side of the mirror as the object, a real image forms. This image is inverted, as shown in the sketch.\nIf the rays diverge after reflection, they appear to intersect behind the mirror, creating a virtual image. This image is upright and located behind the mirror, though no actual ray intersection occurs.\n\nThe point where these rays meet (or appear to meet) determines the image size. By drawing a ray from the object’s tip through the mirror’s center (point O), we can easily determine the image height h_image. As an exercise, consider how this construction demonstrates that the magnification of a concave mirror is given by\n\\[ \\frac{h_{\\text{image}}}{h_{\\text{object}}}=-\\frac{b}{g}=M\\]\nThis ratio indeed represents the magnification \\(M\\). The negative sign in the expression reflects an important optical property: for real images formed by concave mirrors, the image is inverted relative to the object. This inversion is mathematically represented by the negative magnification value. Conversely, a positive magnification would indicate an upright image, which occurs with virtual images.\nWith the help of the imaging equation and the magnification we may in general differentiate between the following general situations:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObject Distance\nImage Characteristics\nImage Position\nMagnification\n\n\n\n\n\\(g &gt; 2f\\)\nReal, inverted, smaller\nBetween f and 2f\n\\(|m|\\) &lt; 1\n\n\n\\(g = 2f\\)\nReal, inverted, same size\nAt 2f\n\\(|m|\\) = 1\n\n\n\\(f &lt; g &lt; 2f\\)\nReal, inverted, larger\nBeyond 2f\n\\(|m|\\) &gt; 1\n\n\n\\(g = f\\)\nImage at infinity\nAt infinity\nN/A\n\n\n\\(g &lt; f\\)\nVirtual, upright, larger\nBehind mirror\n\\(|m|\\) &gt; 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParabolic Mirrors Focus Parallel Rays\n\n\n\n\n\nWe would like to show in the following, that a parabolic mirror is a shape which reflects all light rays parallel to the principal axis to a single point, the focus. This is a fundamental property of parabolic mirrors and is used in many optical systems, such as telescopes, satellite dishes, and car headlights.\nFor this purpose, we would like to use Fermat’s principle. We examine a light ray originating from a point \\(x,y_0\\) and travelling parallel to the principal axis. The light ray is reflected at a point \\((x,y)\\) on the mirror and travels to the focus at \\((0,p)\\). The light path is therefore consisting out of two linear segments \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) for which we have to calculate the time of travel. The total duration of the light’s journey is then: \\[\nt = t_A + t_B\n\\]\nwhere:\n\n\\(t_A\\) is the time taken to travel from \\(x,y_0\\) to the mirror.\n\\(t_B\\) is the time taken to travel from \\((x,y)\\) to \\((0,p)\\).\n\n\n5.1.2.1 Time for Path A\nThe distance covered in path A is equal to \\(y_0 - y\\), where \\(y\\) represents the y-coordinate of the point where the ray meets the mirror. Consequently, the time taken for the light to traverse path A can be expressed as:\n\\[\nt_A = \\frac{y_0 - y}{c}\n\\]\nIn this equation, \\(c\\) represents the speed of light in the medium.\n\n\n5.1.2.2 Time for Path B\nAfter reflection, the light ray travels from the point \\((x, y)\\) on the mirror’s surface to the focal point located at \\((0, p)\\). The length of this segment of the path can be calculated using the distance formula:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{x^2 + (y - p)^2}\n\\]\nConsequently, the time required for the light to traverse path B is expressed as:\n\\[\nt_B = \\frac{\\sqrt{x^2 + (y - p)^2}}{c}\n\\]\n\n\n5.1.2.3 Total Time\nThe total time for the light ray’s journey is the sum of times for paths A and B:\n\\[\nt = \\frac{y_0 - y}{v} + \\frac{\\sqrt{x^2 + (y - p)^2}}{c}\n\\]\nAccording to Fermat’s principle, all light rays should take the same time. We can express this by setting the total time equal to a constant \\(t_c\\):\n\\[\n\\frac{y_0 - y}{v} + \\frac{\\sqrt{x^2 + (y - p)^2}}{v} = t_c\n\\]\nFor a ray traveling along the y-axis, reflecting at \\((0, 0)\\), the total distance is \\(y_0 + p\\). The time for this ray is:\n\\[\n\\frac{y_0 + p}{c}\n\\]\nThis gives us \\(t_c = \\frac{y_0 + p}{c}\\). Substituting into our general equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{y_0 - y}{v} + \\frac{\\sqrt{x^2 + (y - p)^2}}{c} = \\frac{y_0 + p}{c}\n\\]\nMultiplying by \\(c\\) and rearranging:\n\\[\ny_0 - y + \\sqrt{x^2 + (y - p)^2} = y_0 + p\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sqrt{x^2 + (y - p)^2} = y + p\n\\]\nSquaring both sides and simplifying:\n\\[\nx^2 + (y - p)^2 = (y + p)^2\n\\]\n\\[\nx^2 + y^2 - 2py + p^2 = y^2 + 2py + p^2\n\\]\n\\[\nx^2 = 4py\n\\]\nor\n\\[\ny=\\frac{1}{4p}x^2\n\\]\nThis final equation describes a parabola with its focus at \\((0, p)\\). The code below plots a parabolic mirror reflecting parallel rays to the focal point. Yet, I’m cheating a bit here. I’m not calculating the reflected rays, but just plotting them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.7: Parabolic mirror reflecting parallel rays to focal point\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElliptical Mirrors and Fermat’s Principle\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is one interesting feature about elliptical mirrors: they can focus light from one focal point to the other. This is because the sum of the distances from any point on the ellipse to the two focal points is constant. This property is known as the ellipse’s geometric definition and you can try that at home with a piece of string and two pins.\nWe can now apply Fermat’s principle to proof that the light reflected from the ellipse travels a path length that is a saddle point. This means that the path length is stationary with respect to small perturbations in the path. Assuming for example that light travels from one focal point by a different path that is reflected from a line which is tangent to the ellipse at the point of reflection, the path length would be longer at any other point than the initial reflection point.\nOn the other side, if we reflect the ray on a surface that is a circle, which is intersecting the ellipse at the point of reflection, the path length would be shorter at any other point than the initial reflection point. This is a proof that the ellipse is a saddle point.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1.2.4 Mathematical Description\n\n\n5.1.2.5 Ellipse Definition\nConsider an ellipse with semi-major axis \\(a\\) and semi-minor axis \\(b\\), defined by:\n\\[\\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1\\]\n\n5.1.2.5.1 Focal Points\nThe focal points are located at \\(F_1(-c, 0)\\) and \\(F_2(c, 0)\\), where:\n\\[c^2 = a^2 - b^2\\]\n\n\n5.1.2.5.2 Path Length\nLet \\(P(x_0, y_0)\\) be a point on the ellipse. The total path length \\(L\\) from \\(F_1\\) to \\(F_2\\) via \\(P\\) is:\n\\[L = |F_1P| + |PF_2| = \\sqrt{(x_0+c)^2 + y_0^2} + \\sqrt{(x_0-c)^2 + y_0^2}\\]\n\n\n5.1.2.5.3 Fermat’s Principle\nThe path length \\(L\\) is stationary with respect to small perturbations in \\(P\\):\n\\[\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x_0} = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial y_0} = 0 \\quad \\text{at the reflection point}\\]\n\n\n5.1.2.5.4 Tangent Line\nThe tangent line to the ellipse at \\(P(x_0, y_0)\\) is given by:\n\\[\\frac{x_0x}{a^2} + \\frac{y_0y}{b^2} = 1\\]\nLet \\(Q\\) be any point on this tangent line different from \\(P\\). The path \\(F_1 \\to Q \\to F_2\\) is longer than \\(F_1 \\to P \\to F_2\\):\n\\[|F_1Q| + |QF_2| &gt; |F_1P| + |PF_2|\\]\n\n\n5.1.2.5.5 Circle of Curvature\nThe radius of curvature \\(R\\) at \\(P\\) is:\n\\[R = \\frac{(a^2b^2)^{3/2}}{(b^2x_0^2 + a^2y_0^2)^{3/2}}\\]\nThe center of curvature \\(C\\) is located at:\n\\[C = P + R\\cdot\\mathbf{n}\\]\nwhere \\(\\mathbf{n}\\) is the unit normal vector at \\(P\\).\nLet \\(Q\\) be any point on this circle different from \\(P\\). The path \\(F_1 \\to Q \\to F_2\\) is shorter than \\(F_1 \\to P \\to F_2\\):\n\\[|F_1Q| + |QF_2| &lt; |F_1P| + |PF_2|\\]\nAs a consequence, the path length for the reflection on and ellipse between the two focal points must be a saddle point.",

    "text": "6.1 Prism\nPrisms are wedge-shaped optical elements made of a transparent material, such as glass. A special form of such a prism is an isosceles prism with two sides of equal length. The two equal sides enclose an angle \\(\\gamma\\), known as the apex angle of the prism. When light passes through this prism, it undergoes refraction twice.\nFirst, the incident angle \\(\\alpha_1\\) is changed into a refracted angle \\(\\beta_1\\) as the light enters the prism. This refracted ray then hits the second interface at an angle \\(\\beta_2\\), leading to a second refraction as it exits the prism at an angle \\(\\alpha_2\\).\nOf particular interest is the total deflection of the incident ray, which is measured by the angle \\(\\delta\\). This deflection angle represents the difference between the final outgoing angle \\(\\alpha_2\\) and the initial incident angle \\(\\alpha_1\\).\nUnderstanding how this deflection angle changes based on the prism’s properties and the incident angle is crucial in various optical applications. In the following sections, we will explore how to calculate this deflection angle and examine its dependence on different parameters.",

    "text": "Figure 6.1: Refraction of rays on a prism.\n\n\n\n\n\n6.1.1 Deflection angle\nWe can calculate the deflection angle \\(\\delta\\) from a number of considerations. First consider the following relations between the angles in the prism and Snell’s law\n\\[\\beta_1=\\sin^{-1}\\left (\\frac{n_0}{n_1}\\sin(\\alpha_1) \\right)\\] \\[\\beta_2=\\gamma-\\beta_1\\] \\[\\alpha_2=\\sin^{-1}\\left (\\frac{n_1}{n_0}\\sin(\\beta_2)\\right )\\] \\[\\theta_2=\\alpha_2-\\gamma\\]\nwhere \\(\\theta_2\\) is the angle between the incident surface normal and the outgoing ray. The total deflection angle \\(\\delta\\) is then\n\\[\\delta =\\alpha_1-\\beta_1+\\alpha_2-\\beta_2\\]\nor\n\\[\\delta =\\alpha_1+\\alpha_2-\\gamma\\]\nfrom which we obtain\n\\[\\delta=\\alpha_1+\\sin^{-1}\\left (\\frac{n_1}{n_0}\\sin\\left [\\gamma-\\sin^{-1}\\left (\\frac{n_0}{n_1}\\sin(\\alpha_1) \\right)\\right]\\right )-\\gamma\\]\nas the deflection angle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.2: Deflection angle as a function of the incidence angle for different prism angles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.1.2 Minimum deflection angle\nIf we now would like to know how the deflection angle changes with the incident angle \\(\\alpha_1\\), we calculate the derivative of the deflection angle \\(\\delta\\) with respect to \\(\\alpha_1\\), i.e.,\n\\[\\frac{\\mathrm d\\delta}{\\mathrm d\\alpha_1}=1+\\frac{\\mathrm d\\alpha_2}{\\mathrm d \\alpha_1}.\\]\nWe are here especially interested in the case, where this change in deflection is reaching a minimum, i.e., \\(\\mathrm d\\delta/\\mathrm d\\alpha_1 =0\\). This readily yields\n\\[\\mathrm d \\alpha_2=-\\mathrm d\\alpha_1.\\]\nThis means a change in the incidence angle \\(\\mathrm d\\alpha_1\\) yields an opposite change in the outgoing angle \\(-\\mathrm d\\alpha_2\\). We may later observe that in the experiment.\nAs both, the incident and the outgoing angle are related to each other by Snells’s law, we may introduce the derivatives of Snell’s law for both interfaces, e.g.,\n\n\\(\\cos(\\alpha_1)\\mathrm d\\alpha_1=n\\cos(\\beta_1)\\mathrm d\\beta_1\\)\n\\(\\cos(\\alpha_2)\\mathrm d\\alpha_2=n\\cos(\\beta_2)\\mathrm d\\beta_2\\)\n\nwhere \\(n\\) is the refractive index of the prism material and the material outside is air (\\(n_{\\rm air}=1\\)). Replacing \\(\\cos(\\alpha)=\\sqrt{1-\\sin^2(\\alpha)}\\) and dividing the two previous equations by each other readily yields\n\\[\\frac{1-\\sin^2(\\alpha_1)}{1-\\sin^2(\\alpha_2)}=\\frac{n^2-\\sin^2(\\alpha_1)}{n^2-\\sin^2(\\alpha_2)}.\\]\nThe latter equation is for \\(n\\neq 1\\) only satisfied if \\(\\alpha_1=\\alpha_2=\\alpha\\). In this case, the light path through the prism must be symmetric and we may write down the minimum deflection angle \\(\\delta_{\\rm min}\\):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMinimum prism deflection\n\n\n\nThe minimum deflection angle of an isosceles prism with a prism angle \\(\\gamma\\) is given by\n\\[\\delta_{\\rm min}=2\\alpha-\\gamma.\\]\n\n\nGiven this minimum deflection angle \\(\\delta_{\\rm min}\\) and the properties of the prism, we may also write down Snell’s law using \\(\\sin(\\alpha)=n\\sin(\\beta)\\), which results in\n\\[\\sin \\left ( \\frac{\\delta_{\\rm min}+\\gamma}{2}\\right )=n\\sin\\left (\\frac{\\gamma}{2}\\right).\\]\nwhich indicates the dependence of the deflection in the refractive index \\(n\\) of the prism material.\n\n\n6.1.3 Dispersion\nVery important applications now arise from the fact, that the refractive index is a material property, which depends on the color (frequency or wavelength) of light. We do not yet understand the origin of this dependence. The plots below show the wavelength dependence of three different glasses. You may find much more data on the refractive index of different materials in an online database.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.3: Refractive index of different glasses as a function of the wavelength.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.4: Deflection angle as a function of the incidence angle for different wavelengths.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plots have a general feature, which is that the refractive index is largest at small wavelength (blue colors), while it drops continuously with increasing wavelength towards the red (800 nm). If you would characterize the dependence by the slope, i.e., \\(\\mathrm dn/\\mathrm d\\lambda\\) then all displayed curves show in the visible range\n\n\\(\\frac{\\mathrm dn}{\\mathrm d\\lambda}&lt;0\\), is called normal dispersion\n\nwhile\n\n\\(\\frac{\\mathrm dn}{\\mathrm d\\lambda}&gt;0\\), is called anomalous dispersion\n\nThis wavelength dependence of the refractive index will yield a dependence of the deflection angle on the color of light as well. The change of the deflection angle with the refractive index can be calculated to be\n\\[\\frac{\\mathrm d\\delta}{\\mathrm d n}=\\frac{2\\sin(\\gamma/2)}{\\sqrt{1-n^2\\sin^2(\\gamma/2)}}\\]\ntogether with the relation\n\\[\\frac{\\mathrm d \\delta}{\\mathrm d \\lambda}=\\frac{\\mathrm d\\delta}{\\mathrm d n}\\frac{\\mathrm d n}{\\mathrm d\\lambda}\\]\nwe obtain\n\\[\\frac{\\mathrm d\\delta}{\\mathrm d\\lambda}=\\frac{2\\sin(\\gamma/2)}{\\sqrt{1-n^2\\sin^2(\\gamma/2)}}\\frac{\\mathrm d n}{\\mathrm d \\lambda}.\\]\nThe refraction of white light through a prism splits the different colors composing white light spatially into a colored spectrum. In this process, light with the longest wavelength (red) is deflected the least, while light with the shortest wavelength (violet) is deflected the most. This occurs because the refractive index of the prism material varies with wavelength, a phenomenon known as dispersion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.5: Spectrum as created by a prism in the lecture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Spectrum\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Prism\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.6: Deflection of different wavelengths of light in a prism with normal dispersion.\n\n\n\n\n\n6.1.4 Prims spectrograph\nThis wavelength-dependent refraction is crucial as it forms the basis for spectroscopy, a powerful analytical technique that measures and records the intensity of light as a function of wavelength. Spectroscopy allows scientists to analyze the composition and properties of matter by examining its interaction with light across different wavelengths.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Principle of a prism spectrometer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Technical realization of a prism spectrometer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.7: Principle and technical realization of a prism spectrometer.\n\n\n\nDIY prism\nIf you don’t have a prism at home (which most people don’t), you can create a simple substitute using a mirror and a basin of water. Here’s how:\n\nPlace a mirror in a basin of water, partially submerged.\nShine white light from a flashlight onto the mirror.\nObserve the reflected and refracted light, paying special attention to the edges.\n\nFor better results, you can create a small aperture by making a tiny hole in a piece of black paper and placing it in front of the flashlight.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.8: Home made water prism.\n\n\n\nWhile the dependence of water’s refractive index on wavelength is relatively weak, it’s still sufficient to demonstrate the familiar colors of the rainbow. This phenomenon will be referenced later in our discussion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.9: Refractive index of water as a function of the wavelength.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplications of prims\n\n\n\n\n\nPrisms are versatile optical components with a wide range of applications across various fields. Here are some common uses of prisms:\n\n6.1.4.1 Binoculars and Telescopes:\nPorro prisms in traditional binoculars and roof prisms in modern designs serve to correct image inversion and provide a compact form. These prisms enable a longer optical path within a shorter physical length, enhancing magnification while maintaining portability. This design is crucial for both binoculars and some telescopes, offering users powerful magnification in a handheld device.\n\n\n6.1.4.2 Periscopes:\nRight-angle prisms are the key component in periscopes, redirecting light at 90-degree angles. This simple yet effective design allows viewers to see over obstacles or around corners, making periscopes invaluable in submarines and various military applications where direct line of sight is obstructed.\n\n\n6.1.4.3 Beam Splitting:\nCube beamsplitters play a vital role in dividing a single beam of light into two separate beams. This capability is essential in various scientific and medical applications, including interferometry, holography, and optical coherence tomography (OCT). The ability to split light beams precisely opens up numerous possibilities in research and diagnostics.\n\n\n6.1.4.4 Beam Steering:\nRisley prisms, consisting of a pair of rotating wedge prisms, offer precise control over laser beam direction. This technology finds applications in laser scanning, target tracking, and adaptive optics. The ability to steer beams accurately is crucial in fields ranging from military applications to advanced scientific research.\n\n\n6.1.4.5 Digital Projectors:\nTotal Internal Reflection (TIR) prisms are a crucial component in Digital Light Processing (DLP) projectors. They direct light from the lamp to the Digital Micromirror Device (DMD) and then to the projection lens, enabling the high-quality image projection that DLP technology is known for.\n\n\n6.1.4.6 Camera Systems:\nIn Single-Lens Reflex (SLR) cameras, pentaprisms play a critical role in the viewfinder system. They flip the image from the lens to appear upright and correctly oriented in the viewfinder, allowing photographers to accurately compose their shots.\n\n\n6.1.4.7 Laser Systems:\nBrewster prisms find use in laser systems for polarization and wavelength separation. Additionally, dispersing prisms can be employed for wavelength tuning in certain laser setups, providing precise control over the laser’s output characteristics.\n\n\n6.1.4.8 Fiber Optic Communications:\nIn the realm of telecommunications, prisms are utilized in some fiber optic connectors and switches. They help redirect light between fibers, playing a crucial role in maintaining signal integrity and enabling complex network architectures.\n\n\n6.1.4.9 Solar Energy:\nFresnel lenses, a specialized type of prism, are employed in concentrated solar power systems. These lenses focus sunlight efficiently, contributing to the development of more effective solar energy collection technologies.\n\n\n6.1.4.10 Head-Up Displays (HUDs):\nPrisms are an integral part of HUD systems in both automotive and aviation contexts. They project crucial information onto the windshield or a combiner glass, allowing drivers or pilots to access important data without taking their eyes off their primary viewpoint.\n\n\n6.1.4.11 Microscopy:\nNomarski prisms enhance the capabilities of differential interference contrast microscopy. They increase contrast in transparent specimens, enabling scientists to observe details that would be difficult or impossible to see with conventional microscopy techniques.\n\n\n6.1.4.12 Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT):\nIn some OCT systems, prisms are employed for sample arm scanning and reference arm delay. This application of prisms contributes to the high-resolution imaging capabilities of OCT, which is particularly valuable in medical diagnostics, especially in ophthalmology.",

Right: Detailed view of the retina, showing the arrangement and neural connections of rods and cones.\n\n\n\n\n8.1.1 Key Components and Their Functions\n\nPupil and Iris: The pupil, surrounded by the iris, acts as an adjustable aperture. It regulates the amount of light entering the eye and influences the depth of field. In bright conditions, a constricted pupil increases the depth of field, allowing a wider range of distances to be in focus simultaneously.\nLens: Connected to the ciliary muscles, the lens can change its curvature to adjust focal length, a process known as accommodation. This allows the eye to focus on objects at varying distances.\nVitreous Humor: This gel-like substance fills the eye cavity, maintaining its shape and contributing to the eye’s optical properties.\nRetina: The light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye, containing photoreceptor cells (rods and cones) that convert light into neural signals.\n\n\n\n8.1.2 Optical Properties of the Eye\nThe eye’s optical system is asymmetrical due to the different media it interfaces with (air on one side, vitreous humor on the other). This results in different focal lengths:\n\nFront focal length: \\(f_1 = 17\\) mm\nBack focal length: \\(f_2 = 22\\) mm\n\nThese values can change during accommodation for near vision:\n\nClose object front focal length: \\(f_1 = 14\\) mm\nClose object back focal length: \\(f_2 = 19\\) mm\n\nThe eye’s refractive power, measured in diopters (D), is the reciprocal of the focal length in meters. For a relaxed eye:\n\\[P = \\frac{1}{f} = \\frac{1}{0.022 \\text{ m}} \\approx 45.45 \\text{ D}\\]\nDuring accommodation, this can increase to about 52 D.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.2: Illustration of the eye’s focal distances.\n\n\n\n\n\n8.1.3 Photoreceptors: Cones and Rods\nThe retina contains two types of photoreceptor cells:\n\nCones: Responsible for color vision and high acuity in bright light. They are concentrated around the fovea, the area of highest visual acuity.\nRods: More sensitive to light but do not distinguish colors, providing vision in low light conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.3: Distribution of cones and rods around the fovea, their microscopic structure, and spectral sensitivity.\n\n\n\nCones contain light-sensitive pigments based on retinal molecules, which undergo conformational changes when excited by light, triggering a cascade of chemical processes. There are three types of cones, each sensitive to different wavelengths of light, enabling color vision.\n\n\n8.1.4 Visual Acuity and Performance\nVisual acuity, often measured using an eye chart, quantifies the eye’s ability to resolve fine details. It’s typically expressed as a fraction (e.g., 20/20 vision), where the numerator is the test distance and the denominator is the distance at which a person with normal acuity can read the same line.\nThe human eye’s remarkable performance in pattern recognition, depth perception, and adaptability to varying light conditions is achieved through the complex interplay of its optical components and neural processing. This sophisticated system continues to inspire developments in artificial vision systems and optical technologies.\n\n\n8.1.5 Resolution Limit of the Eye\nThe resolution of the eye is limited by diffraction and the spacing of photoreceptors. The minimum angle of resolution θ_min can be approximated by:\n\\[\\theta_{\\text{min}} \\approx \\frac{1.22\\lambda}{D}\\]\nwhere λ is the wavelength of light and D is the diameter of the pupil. For a 3 mm pupil and 555 nm light (peak sensitivity), this gives a theoretical resolution of about 1 arc minute.\n\n\n8.1.6 Refractive Errors and Visual Correction\nThe human eye, under normal conditions, focuses images of distant objects onto the retina at the back focal distance of approximately 22 mm. However, various refractive errors can occur due to imperfections in the eye’s optical system, primarily the cornea and lens. These errors affect the eye’s ability to focus light accurately on the retina, leading to vision problems.\nCommon refractive errors include:\n\nMyopia (Short-sightedness): Light from distant objects focuses in front of the retina, causing distant objects to appear blurry while near objects remain clear.\nHyperopia (Far-sightedness): Light focuses behind the retina, making nearby objects appear blurry while distant objects may remain clear.\nAstigmatism: The cornea or lens isn’t perfectly spherical, causing light to focus at multiple points rather than a single sharp point on the retina.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Correction of Myopia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Correction of Hyperopia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.4: Left: Myopia correction using a concave lens. Right: Hyperopia correction using a convex lens.\n\n\n\nThe severity of refractive errors can be quantified using the concept of refractive power. The refractive error R of the eye, measured in diopters (D), is calculated as:\n\\[R = \\frac{1}{f_{\\text{required}}} - \\frac{1}{f_{\\text{actual}}}\\]\nwhere f_required is the focal length needed for perfect focus, and f_actual is the eye’s actual focal length. This formula helps determine the degree of correction needed for various eye defects.\nIn a normal, relaxed state, the human eye can observe objects clearly up to a distance of approximately 25 cm without additional accommodation of the lens. This distance, known as the range of clear visual sight, varies among individuals and is used as a standard in optical calculations. Objects within this range can be observed under a visual angle ε. For small angles, which is typically the case in vision, the angular size θ of an object of height h at a distance d is approximated by:\n\\[\n\\theta \\approx \\tan(\\theta) = \\frac{h}{d}\n\\]\nThis relationship is fundamental in understanding how objects are perceived and in designing corrective lenses and optical instruments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.5: Diagram of a relaxed eye focusing on a distant object.\n\n\n\nUnderstanding these concepts is crucial for diagnosing vision problems and designing appropriate corrective measures, whether through eyeglasses, contact lenses, or surgical interventions.\n\n\n8.1.7 Magnification\nHaving discussed the basic structure and function of the human eye, we now turn to how optical instruments can enhance our vision. Instead of calculating the magnification of optical instruments from object and image distances, we introduce a more relevant measure: the angular magnification.\nThe angular magnification, V, is defined as the ratio of the angle subtended by the image when viewed through the instrument to the angle subtended by the object when viewed with the naked eye at the near point. It is given by:\n\\[\nV=\\frac{\\tan(\\epsilon)}{\\tan(\\epsilon_0)}\\approx \\frac{\\epsilon}{\\epsilon_0}\n\\]\nwhere: - ε is the angle subtended by the image at the eye when viewed through the instrument - ε₀ is the angle subtended by the object when viewed with the naked eye at the near point\nThis concept is crucial in understanding how optical instruments like telescopes and microscopes enhance our vision. Angular magnification effectively increases the apparent size of objects by increasing the angle at which they are viewed. This measure is particularly useful as the actual image size is often not directly accessible or relevant to the viewer’s experience.",

    "text": "9.1 Magnifying Glass\nA magnifying glass has several applications. First of all, it allows to see objects with details that would otherwise be too small to be observed with the eye even of the eye lens can accommodate to the distances. Such magnifying glasses are also used in microscopes as the so-called eye-piece as we will later see in the section on microscopes.\nConsider the sketch below. The sketch shows an object of a size \\(A\\) which is at a distance of \\(s_0\\) from the eye. The object makes an angle \\(\\epsilon_0\\) with the optical axis. If we insert now a lens into the space between object and eye and the lens is positioned in a way that it is exactly at a distance \\(f\\) (the focal distance of the lens) from the object then we are able to observe the object under a different angle \\(\\epsilon\\).\nThe magnification of this magnifying glass can the be calculated from the angles \\(\\epsilon\\approx A/f\\) and \\(\\epsilon_0\\approx A/s_0\\):\n\\[\nV=\\frac{\\tan(\\epsilon)}{\\tan(\\epsilon_0)}\\approx \\frac{\\epsilon}{\\epsilon_0}=\\frac{A}{f}\\frac{s_0}{A}=\\frac{s_0}{f}.\n\\]\nThe angular magnification is, thus, just given by the ratio of the clear visual range to the focal distance of the lens. If the focal distance \\(f\\) becomes much smaller than \\(s_0\\), large magnifications are possible.\nA second very useful effect is that when the object is placed inside the focal distance from the lens, the eye images a virtual image at infinite distance to the retina (see sketch). This means the eye muscle can stay relaxed when observing the object, while it would otherwise probably have to accommodate to the distance.\nYet, placing the object at exactly the focal distance is rather tedious when holding the magnifying glass by hand. If the object is now placed inside the focal distance of the magnifying glass, we may also calculate a magnification in this case knowing the virtual image size \\(B\\) created in this case (see sketch below)\nIf \\(a\\) is the distance of the object from the principle plane of the magnifying glass and \\(b\\) and \\(B\\) are the distance and the size of the virtual image, respectively, we obtain\n\\[\nV=\\frac{\\tan(\\epsilon)}{\\tan(\\epsilon_0)}\\approx \\frac{\\epsilon}{\\epsilon_0}=\\frac{B}{b}\\frac{s_0}{A}=\\frac{s_0}{a}.\n\\]\nUsing the imaging equation\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{f}=\\frac{1}{a}+\\frac{1}{b}\n\\]\nwe may finally arrive at\n\\[\nV=\\frac{s_0(b-f)}{b\\,f}\n\\]\nin this case. If we place the virtual image directly at the clear visual range, i.e., \\(b=-s_0\\), we find\n\\[\nV=\\frac{s_0}{f}+1.\n\\]",

Yet, the key to the performance of a microscope is the understanding provided by wave optics. We will discuss this in a later section. The simplest form of a microscope consists of an objective lens with a focal distance \\(f_1\\) and a magnifying glass called eye-piece with a focal length \\(f_2\\). In this system of two lenses (which are itself systems of lenses in modern microscopes, see below),\nthe object is placed at a distance \\(f_1&lt; a_1&lt;2f_1\\) from the objective lens creating a real and reversed image at a distance \\(b_1\\) behind the lens. This reversed image is observed by the eye through the eye-piece. The image of the objective lens is thereby adjusted to appear at the focal distance of the eye-piece.\nFor this simple microscope system we may calculate first the intermediate image position \\(b_1\\):\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{f_1}=\\frac{1}{a_1}+\\frac{1}{b_1}\n\\]\nresulting in\n\\[\nb_1=\\frac{a_1 f_1}{a_1-f_1}.\n\\]\nIf we assume a \\(\\delta\\) to be the distance of the object from the focal point of the objective lens, we even find for \\(\\delta \\rightarrow 0\\)\n\\[\nb_1=\\frac{a_1 f_1}{\\delta}.\n\\]\nThe intermediate image of size \\(B_1\\) is now imaged by a magnifying glass of focal distance \\(f_2\\). According to what we calculated earlier, we have now the observation angle\n\\[\n\\tan(\\epsilon)=\\frac{B_1}{f_2}=\\frac{Ab}{a_1 f_2}.\n\\]\nIf we observe the object of a size \\(A\\) and the clear visual distance \\(s_0\\), it would cover an angle of\n\\[\n\\tan(\\epsilon_0)=\\frac{A}{s_0}\n\\]\nand we may obtain the total angular magnification\n\\[\nV=\\frac{A b_1 s_0}{A b_1 f_2}=\\frac{b_1 s_0}{g f_2}.\n\\]\nIf we set the distance between the two lenses to \\(D=b_1+f_2\\) and \\(g\\approx f_1\\) then we obtain\n\\[\nV=\\frac{(D-f_2)s_0}{f_1 f_2}\n\\]\nwhich says that the magnification is the result of the two focal length \\(f_1,f_2\\).",

    "text": "Historical Context of Microscope Development\n\n\n\n\n\nOptical Microscopy has a rich history of development, and is a very important tool in the fields of biology, materials science, and nanotechnology. Here are some key milestones in the history of microscopy:\nAncient Times - 13th Century: Simple magnifying glasses - The concept of magnification was known to ancient civilizations. - In the 13th century, Italian craftsmen created the first wearable glasses.\n1590: Compound Microscope - Hans and Zacharias Janssen, Dutch spectacle makers, created the first compound microscope.\n1665: Robert Hooke’s “Micrographia” - Hooke published detailed observations made with his improved compound microscope. - He coined the term “cell” after observing cork tissue.\n1670s: Antonie van Leeuwenhoek’s Single-Lens Microscopes - Developed high-quality single-lens microscopes with up to 270x magnification. - First to observe and describe bacteria, yeast, and other microorganisms.\n\n\n\nImage of Leeuwenhoek’s microscope\n\n\n18th-19th Centuries: Achromatic Lenses - Joseph Jackson Lister developed achromatic lenses, reducing chromatic aberration.\n1830s: Ernst Abbe’s Theoretical Work - Formulated the Abbe Sine Condition, crucial for modern lens design.\nLate 19th Century: Oil Immersion Lenses - Allowed for higher resolution in light microscopy.\n1931: Electron Microscope - Ernst Ruska and Max Knoll developed the first electron microscope.\n1950s-1960s: Phase Contrast and Fluorescence Microscopy - Frits Zernike invented phase contrast microscopy. - Development of fluorescence microscopy techniques.\n1981: Scanning Tunneling Microscope - Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer invented the STM, allowing imaging at the atomic level.\n1980s-Present: Digital and Computational Microscopy - Integration of CCD cameras and digital imaging. - Development of confocal microscopy, super-resolution techniques, and computational methods like ptychography.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig.: Cut through a microscope objective lens (left) and an eye-piece.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig.: Sketch of a simple microscope.

This system incorporates an objective lens that projects images of objects in the focal plane to infinity. Such an objective lens is invariably paired with a secondary lens, called the tube lens. Together, these lenses are engineered to provide a magnification level that is specified on the objective lens housing.\n\n\n\nFig.: Infinity optics vs. normal microscopy optics.\n\n\nInfinity optics allows you to have a free length with a parallel optical path where you can insert optical elements. There is no fixed tube length as in the case sketched above, where the distance of the intermediate image has to be considered. Therefore, it has tremendous technical advantages. Common optical microscopes are further today coupled to CCD cameras to record images digitally. Yet, an eye-piece may still be available in many cases. The sketch below shows the light path for a simple fluorescence microscope recording fluorescence images with a camera.\n\n\n\nFig.: Simple fluorescence microscope.\n\n\n\n\n10.1.0.2 Digital Microscopy\nThe possibility to digitally record images creates endless possibilities to computationally enhance and combine images. Nowadays the field of optics is one of the fastest developing fields in physics with numerous new techniques appearing every week. In this field of imaging methods of machine learning also play an increasingly important role. While I’m not ablields in physics with numerous new techniques appearing every week. In this field of imaging methods of machine learning also play an increasingly important role. While I am not able to refer to all possible optical microscopy techniques he to refer to all possible optical microscopy techniques here, I will exemplarily show some data from the Waller group at Berkley using computational methods to enhance the resolution by keeping at the same time a large field of view for imaging. This technique is called ptychography and can be understood if you consider Fourier Optics (a field of optics describing ligh propagation in terms Fourier transforms).\n\n\n\nFig.: Ptychographic imaging with LED arrays.\n\n\nThere is a massive amount of other techniques with increadible images being generated. Have a look around.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced Microscopy Techniques\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile traditional light microscopy has been invaluable, it’s limited by the diffraction of light, restricting resolution to about 200 nm as will be discussed in a later part of this course. Modern techniques have pushed beyond this limit, revolutionizing our ability to visualize microscopic structures.\n\n\n\nSuper resolution Imaging Methods Overview (Schermelleh, L. et al. Super-resolution microscopy demystified.
