## Do atoms exist?

We will examine historical experiments that addressed the question of atomic existence. Therefore, we will discuss Dalton's law and the law of Gay-Lussac before we resolve the structure of atoms an the basis of Thomson's and Rutherford's experiments.

The earliest documented concept of matter's structure as infinitesimally small, space-filling particles comes from the Greek philosophers *Leucippus* and *Democritus* (5th century BCE). These philosophers proposed that particles differ in size and shape, and that the properties of macroscopic objects arise from the arrangement of these particles. They called these particles "*$\alpha \tau o \mu o \zeta$" (atoms) because they believed them to be indivisible. A century later, *Epicurus* expanded this atomic theory by attributing the additional characteristic of mass to these particles, beyond their spatial properties.

## Atoms and molecules

### Dalton's law

On the basis of precise quantitative analyses of chemical reaction and the ratios of educts and products, John Dalton developed the idea that every chemical compound is composed of substances, whereas the ratio of these substance is constant for a particular compound and the ratio unambiguously identifies a compound. In 1803 Dalton developed his idea of a chemical reaction being the separation and association of atoms, and published this idea in 1808 "*A New System of Chemical Philosophy*". This publication stated three postulates:

- All chemical elements are composed of small particles which cannot be dismantled any further.
- All atoms of the same chemical element are identical in quality, size, and mass. However, these properties differ from the according properties of other elements. Consequently, the characteristics of an element are governed through the properties of its atoms.
- If chemical elements form a chemical compounds, their atoms associate in a ratio of integers.

### The law of Gay-Lussac

In 1805 Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac and Alexander von Humboldt discovered that hydrogen and oxygen at the same (partial-) pressure associate to water if they use volume ratios of 2:1, respectively. Later Gay-Lussac published: "If two or more gaseous substances associate at equal pressure and equal temperature, their volumes have an integer ratio".

### The Avogadro number
In 1811 Amedeo Avogadro introduced the term "molecule" as the smallest particle of a gas that retains the characteristics of that gas. He hypothesized that at identical pressure and temperature, equal volumes of different gases contain the same number of molecules. From these experimental findings emerged the concept of "molar volume." The initial definition of molar volume was the volume occupied by 1 mol of a gas at standard conditions ($p = 1013\mbox{ hPa}, T = 0 \mbox{ °C}$), where the mass in grams corresponds to the molecular weight of the gas molecules. The modern, general definition of 1 mol is the number of particles that corresponds to 12 g of carbon ${}^{12}\mbox{C}$, which applies to both gaseous and non-gaseous substances. The molar volume is $V_{\mathrm{M}} = 22.414\mbox{ l}$ and the Avogadro number is $N_{\mbox{A}} = 6.022 \cdot 10^{23} \mbox{ mol}^{-1}$.

One practical method to determine the Avogadro number is the oil spot experiment. A small drop of oil with known volume $V$ spreads on a water surface to form a thin film of thickness $h$ equal to one molecule's diameter. If $A$ is the area of the circular film, then:

$h = \frac{V}{A}$

Since we know the oil's density $\rho$ and molar mass $M$, we can calculate the number of molecules in the drop:

$N = \frac{\rho V}{M} N_A$

The volume of one molecule is:

$v = \frac{V}{N} = \frac{M}{\rho N_A}$

Since the thickness $h$ equals the diameter of one molecule, we can write:

$h^3 = \frac{6M}{\pi \rho N_A}$

Solving for $N_A$:

$N_A = \frac{6M}{\pi \rho h^3}$

Using oleic acid ($\mathrm{C_{18}H_{34}O_2}$), this method typically yields results within an order of magnitude of the accepted value.

These experimental findings and concepts paved the way for the modern understanding that matter is generally composed of atoms.

## The Structure of atoms

### Indication of charged particles within atoms

At the end of the 19th century experimental findings accumulated indicating matter bears charged particles. The main results were:
- Experiments on electrolytic current demonstrated that molecules can dissociate, whereas the resulting ions migrate in opposite directions and transport charges and mass.
- Gas discharging phenomena are influenced through electric and magnetic fields. Thus, discharging is correlated to motion of charged particles.
- Magnetic phenomena arise from electric conduction in metals and semiconductors.
- $\alpha$ and $\beta$ radiation are deflected through magnetic fields; $\alpha$ and $\beta$ particles are positively charged, heavy particles and negatively charged, light particles, respectively.
Consequently the concept of matter being composed of atoms was extended. Atoms in turn consist of positively and negatively charged particles which bear mass and charge.

Johann Wilhelm Hittorf observed in a gas discharge tubes that particles emitted from a cathode propagate at straight lines. Moreover, these particles can be deflected with the aid of a magnet. As a consequence of the emission from the cathode and the direction of the magnetic poles, these particles had to be negatively charged. Later in 1897, Joseph John Thomson determined the charge-to-mass ratio $e/m$ and demonstrated that this ratio is independent of the cathode material. In contrast to charged particles emitted from the cathode, Eugen Goldstein observed in 1886 a ray emitted from the anode which is propagating in the opposite direction than the cathode ray. In 1887 Wilhelm Wien reported from a $10^{-4}$ reduced charge-to-mass ratio of this anode ray and concluded that these particles are charged gas ions.

In 1899 Thomson and Charles Wilson studied sinking droplets of condensed water vapor. The speed of falling was depending on the size of the droplets and the viscosity of the retarding gas. While measuring the amount of water and charges Thomson and Wilson were able to estimate the elementary charge of about $10^{-19} \mbox{ C}$. In 1910 Robert Andrews Millikan studied oil droplets rising and falling in a capacitor. On the basis of this method, the elementary charge is determined as $e = 1.602\cdot 10^{-19} \mbox{ C}$.

Concerning the mass of an electron, its value is still only accessible via the charge-to-mass ratio. A precise measurement of the $e/m$ ratio is possible with a Wien filter. To do so, an electron is accelerated by means of a voltage, whereas perpendicular to the propagation direction an electric filed deflects the electron beam. In addition a magnetic field is used to compensate the deflection. Thus, the $e/m$ ratio depends only on the applied accelerating voltage and the electric and magnetic fields.

### The Thomson model

At the beginning of the 20th century only negatively charged electrons as cathode rays and positively charged $\alpha$ particles were available for scattering experiments. However, if $\alpha$ particles are scattered at atoms, the electrons will have only a minor effect. The scattering depends for the most part on the spatial arrangement of positive charges within the atoms.

As a first attempt, in 1904 Thompson proposed the **"Plump Pudding Model"**. According to this model every atom consists of a number of $Z$ electrons with a cumulative charge of $-Z\cdot e$ and a number of $Z$ positive charges. Thus, the atoms appear neutral on the macroscopic scale.

Indication of a not-sufficient description is provided on the basis of simple calculations. If the $Z$ electrons are equally distributed within a sphere with the radius $R$ the electron density would measure
$$
n_e = \frac{Z}{\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3} \mathrm{.}
$$
Then, the plasma frequency would result in
$$
\omega_p = \sqrt{\frac{n_e \cdot e^2}{\epsilon_0 \cdot m_e}} = \sqrt{\frac{3 Z e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 R^3 m_e}} \mathrm{.}
$$
However, the estimated absorption and emission frequencies did not coincide with experimental results.

### The Rutherford model

In 1909 Rutherford, Geiger and Marsden conducted scattering experiments of $\alpha$ particles on gold foil. By means of a new, turnable apparatus they were able to detect angles of scattering up to $180^{\circ}$. They recorded scattering signals at such angles which clearly contradicted the plump pudding model. In 1911 Rutherford proposed a model that explains the scattering signal. As a consequence all positive charges have to be compacted in a small volume at the center of an atom, and so most of the mass.

In order to calculate how the $\alpha$ particles are scattered we define the number of particles per unit time impinging on an area $A$ of the scattering volume $V$ being $\dot{N} \cdot A$ and the number of particles per unit time being scattered into the solid angle $\Delta \Omega$ around $\vartheta$ being $\Delta \dot{N} \left( \vartheta, \Omega \right)$. The fraction of impinging particles being scattered into the solid angle $\Delta \Omega$ then results in

$$
\frac{\Delta \dot{N}}{\dot{N} \cdot A} = n_B \; \frac{V}{A} \; \frac{\mathrm{d} \sigma}{\mathrm{d} \Omega} \Delta \Omega = n_B \; \Delta x \; \frac{\mathrm{d} \sigma}{\mathrm{d} \Omega} \; \Delta \Omega \mathrm{,}
$$

which is determined through the density of scattering centers $n_B$, the length of the scattering path $\Delta x$, and the scattering cross section $\frac{\mathrm{d} \sigma}{\mathrm{d} \Omega}$.

Concerning scattering on a Coulomb potential with the point-like charge $Z\cdot e$ we make use of the relation between the scattering angle $\vartheta$ and impact parameter $b$

$$
\cot \left( \frac{\vartheta}{2} \right) = \frac{4 \pi \epsilon_0}{q Q} \mu v_0^2 b
$$

with $q=2e$, $Q=Ze$, and $\mu = \mu_{\alpha} \mu_{C}/(\mu_{\alpha}+\mu_{C})$. The latter denote the reduced mass of an $\alpha$ particle and the atomic core. In order to calculate the fraction of particles being scattered at an angle $\vartheta \pm \frac{1}{2} \Delta \vartheta$ and reaching the detector with an area of

$$
\Delta A_D = R \sin \left( \vartheta \right) \cdot R \Delta \vartheta \Delta \phi = R^2 \sin \left( \vartheta \right) \; \Delta \Omega
$$

we make use of the definition of the differential scattering cross section

$$
\frac{\mathrm{d}\sigma}{\mathrm{d}\Omega} = b \cdot \frac{\mathrm{d}b}{\mathrm{d}\vartheta}  \frac{1}{\sin \left( \vartheta \right)}
$$

and calculate the derivative of $b$ with respect to $\vartheta$

$$
\frac{\mathrm{d}b}{\mathrm{d}\vartheta} = \frac{qQ}{8 \pi \epsilon_0 \mu v_0^2}  \frac{1}{\sin^2 \left( \frac{\vartheta}{2} \right)} \mathrm{.}
$$

When making again use of the relation between the scattering angle $\vartheta$ and impact parameter $b$ and the relation $\sin \left( \vartheta \right) = 2 \sin \left( \frac{\vartheta}{2} \right)\cos \left( \frac{\vartheta}{2} \right)$, we can calculate the differential scattering cross section of a particle with charge $q$ and reduced mass $\mu$ in the Coulomb field of the charge $Q$

$$
\frac{\mathrm{d} \sigma}{\mathrm{d}\Omega} = \frac{1}{4} \left( \frac{qQ}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 \mu v_0^2} \right)^2 \; \frac{1}{\sin^4 \left( \frac{\vartheta}{2} \right)}
$$

If we use $E_{\mathrm{kin}} = \mu \cdot v_0^2$ and $\mu \approx m_{\alpha}$, we obtain

$$
\frac{\Delta \dot{N}}{\dot{N} \cdot A} = n_{\mathrm{Gold}} \; \Delta x \; \frac{1}{4 R^2} \; \left( \frac{qQ}{8 \pi \epsilon_0 E_{\mathrm{kin}}} \right)^2 \; \frac{\Delta A_{\mathrm{d}}}{\sin^4 \left( \frac{\vartheta}{2} \right)} \mathrm{,}
$$

which is the Rutherford formula. This formula reproduced the measured data except for big angles, and thus small impact parameters. Rutherford concluded that deviations at big angles arise from the nuclei which are in fact small compared to an atom but not point-like.
