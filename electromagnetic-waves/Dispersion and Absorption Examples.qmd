The Abbe refractometer provides a precise method for measuring refractive indices of liquids:

1. Operating principle: Total internal reflection at critical angle
2. Typical accuracy: ±0.0002
3. Procedure:
   - Place sample between prisms
   - Adjust viewing angle until bright/dark boundary appears
   - Read refractive index directly from scale
4. Applications:
   - Quality control in food/chemical industries
   - Concentration measurements
   - Purity testing
```

### 2. Dispersion Demonstration

```python
### Example box: Prism Spectroscopy
Simple but effective demonstration using:
