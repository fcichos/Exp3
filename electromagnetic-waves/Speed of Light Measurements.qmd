## Michelson Morley experiment

The Michelson-Morley experiment of 1887 was designed to detect the hypothetical luminiferous ether through which light was thought to propagate. Using an interferometer, they split a light beam into two perpendicular paths and recombined them to create an interference pattern. The theoretical derivation considered the time for light to travel in both directions: along the direction of Earth's motion through the ether, the outward and return journey times are given by:

$$t_1 = \frac{L}{c-v}$$
$$t_2 = \frac{L}{c+v}$$

where $L$ is the arm length, $c$ is the speed of light, and $v$ is Earth's velocity through the ether. The total time for this path is therefore:

$$T_1 = t_1 + t_2 = \frac{L}{c-v} + \frac{L}{c+v} = \frac{2Lc}{c^2-v^2}$$

For the perpendicular arm, the time calculation involved the Pythagorean theorem, as light would travel diagonally relative to the ether, giving:

$$T_2 = \frac{2L}{\sqrt{c^2-v^2}}$$

The time difference $\Delta T = $T_{1} - T_{2}$, when expanded using the binomial theorem and keeping terms to second order in $v/c$, yields:

$$\Delta T = \frac{L}{c} \times \frac{v^2}{c^2}$$

This time difference corresponds to a path difference of:

$$\Delta d = 2L\frac{v^2}{c^2}$$

However, Michelson and Morley observed no significant fringe shift, contradicting the ether theory and paving the way for special relativity, which established the constancy of the speed of light in all inertial reference frames.


## Foucault Rotating Mirror

The Foucault Rotating Mirror Method uses a rotating mirror to measure the speed of light. Here's how each equation contributes to the measurement:

Path length difference: The total distance light travels is twice the sum of distances $f$ and $b$
$$
\Delta s =2(f+b)
$$

Angular displacement: Related to the mirror's rotation frequency ($ν$) and time difference ($\Delta t$)
$$
\Delta \alpha=2\pi\nu \Delta t
$$

Linear displacement: The observed displacement at distance a from the mirror

$$
\Delta x = 2 \Delta \alpha a
$$

Geometric relationship: Angular displacement in terms of linear displacement
$$
\Delta \alpha=\frac{\Delta x}{2a}
$$

Combining rotation and displacement: Substituting the angular relationships

$$
\frac{\Delta x}{2a}=2\pi\nu \Delta t
$$

Time difference: Solved from the above equation
$$
\Delta t=\frac{\Delta x}{4\pi\nu a}
$$

Speed of light: Final equation combining path length and time difference
$$
c=\frac{\Delta s}{\Delta t}=\frac{8\pi\nu (f+b)a}{\Delta x}
$$

This method allows calculation of $c$ by measuring the angular velocity of the mirror ($ν$), the distances ($f$, $4$, and $a$), and the observed displacement ($\Delta x$).
